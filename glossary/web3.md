### Open Source

> Software for which the original source code is made **freely available** and **may be redistributed and modified.**
>
> Many great projects are developed under an open source model, where developers, community members, and users come together to build and improve a product.

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)
* Examples of open source projects:
  * Linux \(Operating system\)
  * Python \(High-level programming language\)
  * PostgreSQL \(Relational query and database language\)
  * Word Press \(Content management system for web\)
  * Drupal \(Content management system\)

### Web3

> **Web3** is the vision of the serverless internet, a decentralized web. An internet where users are in control of their own data, identity, and destiny.

### Ethereum

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2836%29.png)

> **Ethereum** is a decentralized platform that runs **smart contracts**: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

### Smart Contract

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

> A **smart contract** is a computer program or a transaction protocol respectively, which is intended to automatically execute, control or document respectively legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a **contract**, of an agreement or of a negotiation.

### Gas

![In the Ethereum blockchain, &quot;Gas&quot; is an abstraction of the resources needed to &quot;write&quot; data.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2831%29.png)

> **Gas** is the pricing value required to **conduct a transaction** or **execute a contract** on the Ethereum blockchain platform. It can be seen as a **fee** that any user pays when **writing** information into the Ethereum network; this could be a transaction, a deployment of a smart contract, sending a proposal to an organization, just to mention a few. The price of Gas is set by the market \(supply and demand\), and varies over time.

### Wallet

![Different wallets can hold different crypto assets, such as Ether or ERC20 Tokens](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png)

> A **cryptocurrency wallet** is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores **public and private keys** and can be used to track ownership, receive or spend **cryptocurrencies**.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are many wallet providers other than Metamask. We encourage you to do your research to find the one that best suits your needs.
{% endhint %}

### ERC20 Token

![Tokens are commonly used to represent value, like currency or assets.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

> **Ethereum tokens** are simply digital assets built on top of the **Ethereum** blockchain. They can be **created by anyone** with access to the Ethereum network. The **ERC20** is the most popular standards for creating tokens on Ethereum.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Keep in mind that not all tokens hold value, nor are backed by any type of collateral. Be cautious when accepting payments in tokens, as anyone can create their own. As of June 2020 there are nearly 200,000 different tokens registered on the Ethereum Blockchain, the vast majority of which hold no "market value."

### DAO

![DAOs are normally organized by members who work together to achieve a common goal.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

> A **Decentralized Autonomous Organization** \(DAO\) supports itself on multiple **smart contracts** to perform its functions. This type of organization is represented by **rules** encoded as a computer program that is **transparent**, controlled by **stakeholders**, and **not influenced** by a central government. Anyone with an Ethereum Wallet can interact with a DAO.
