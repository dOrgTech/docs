# Core Values

![](https://i.gifer.com/HAhw.gif)

### Peer **s**upport & collaboration

dOrg began as a group of engineers interested in building web3 software together. We've since developed a strong culture of helping one another to learn, overcome challenges, and grow.

### **Individual autonomy**

We empower everyone to be a leader and start new initiatives. We respect each other's freedom to choose what to work on, when, and from where to work.

### Radical transparency

We strive to make all info accessible to every builder. On-chain fund management, well-documented processes, and forum-based deliberation are just a few ways we achieve this.

### **Decentralized ownership and decision-making**

We fluidly distribute control and rewards to each builder based on value contributed, not titles or hierarchy.

### **Kindness and respect**

We are committed to maintaining a healthy digital workplace as outlined in our [Builder Covenant](lifecycle/covenant.md).
