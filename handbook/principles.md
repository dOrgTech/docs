# Core Values

![](https://i.gifer.com/HAhw.gif)

### Peer **s**upport & collaboration

dOrg began when a group of freelancers joined forces to enjoy the benefits of working together. We've since developed a strong culture of helping one another to learn, grow and overcome challenges.

### **Individual autonomy**

We empower everyone to be a leader and start new initiatives. We also respect each other's freedom to choose what to work on, when, and where to work from.

### Radical transparency

We strive to keep all information available to every builder. Thoroughly documenting all processes, managing funds on-chain, and deliberating in a shared forum are just a few of the ways we achieve this.

### **Decentralized ownership and decision-making**

We fluidly distribute control and rewards based value contributed, not titles or hierarchy.

### **Kindness and respect**

We are committed to maintaining a healthy digital workplace as outlined in our [Builder Covenant](lifecycle/covenant.md).
