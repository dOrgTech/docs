## 1. Join our [database](https://airtable.com/shr0eQZfACL3Yarac)

When the need arises for your skills and experience, we'll reach out to schedule an interview. Due to the amount of interest, we can only reach out in response to corresponding demand. Please note that we prioritize referrals from other dOrg members.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In the meantime pop into our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6Kujmad) and say hello 👋.

## 2. Interview with an existing dOrg member

Interviews are conducted by a member with a [_Tech Lead_](../workflows/tech-lead.md) or [_Project Manager_](../workflows/project-manager.md) badge depending on whether the role is technical or not. Please be prepared to discuss details about your area of expertise and past professional experience, as well as your current web3 involvement and interests.

## 3. Wait for a proposal

The interviewer will make their recommendation to the collective on whether to proceed with a vote. If the collective votes to approve your application, you will be invited to onboard.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are a dOrg member referring a friend or you have a talent need for your project, create a post describing the candidate [here](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/about-the-builder-activations-category).
