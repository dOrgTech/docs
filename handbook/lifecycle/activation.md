## 1. Join our [database](https://airtable.com/shr0eQZfACL3Yarac) of highly skilled builders

When the need arises for your skills and experience, we'll reach out to schedule an interview. Unfortunately, due to the amount of interest, we only reach out to builders in response to corresponding demand.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the meantime pop into our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6Kujmad) and say hello ðŸ‘‹.
{% endhint %}

## 2. Interview with an existing dOrg builder

Interviews are conducted by a builder with a [_Tech Lead_](../workflows/tech-lead.md) or [_Project Manager_](../workflows/project-manager.md) badge depending on whether the role is technical or not. Please be prepared to discuss details about your area of expertise and past professional experience, as well as your current Web3 involvement and interests.

## 3. Wait for a proposal

The interviewer will make their recommendation to the collective on whether to proceed with a vote. If the collective votes to approve your activation, you will be invited to onboard.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are a dOrg builder referring a friend or you have a talent need for your project, create a post describing the candidate [here](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/about-the-builder-activations-category).
