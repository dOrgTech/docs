# Activation

Interested in joining our collective? Follow the steps below!

![](../.gitbook/assets/plant2.gif)

## 1. Join our [database](https://airtable.com/shr0eQZfACL3Yarac) of highly skilled builders

Thank you for your interest in becoming a dOrg builder!  
  
We bring in new builders when we have a specific role we think your skills and experience match or when we notice a request from our Project Managers and Sourcing Leads for particular skill sets.  
  
If a suitable role arises, we'll reach out to schedule an interview. Unfortunately, due to the amount of interest, we can only respond to builders that we have a match for. However, we'll keep your details and if a future match arises, we'll be in touch to ask if you're still interested.

In the meantime pop into our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6Kujmad) and say hello ðŸ‘‹.
{% endhint %}

## 2. Interview with an existing dOrg builder

Interviews will be conducted by a builder with a [_Tech Lead_](../workflows/tech-lead.md) or [_Project Manager_](../workflows/project-manager.md) badge depending on whether the role is technical or not. Please be prepared to discuss details about your area of expertise and past professional experience, as well as your current Web3 experience and interests.

## 3. dOrg Votes

The interviewer will make their recommendation to the collective on whether to proceed with a vote. If the collective votes to approve your activation, you will be invited to become an active dOrg member and move onto onboarding.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are a dOrg builder referring a friend or you have a talent need for your project, create a post here describing the candidate [here](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/about-the-builder-activations-category).
