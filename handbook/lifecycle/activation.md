## 4. Redeem

Now that submission is on-chain, dOrg builders will review and vote. Proposals are typically processed in 2 - 7 days. 

If your proposal passes, you will receive **100 xDAI** + **100 Rep** and move on to [Onboarding](onboarding.md). If the DAO rejects your proposal, don't worry – you can always try again! Currently we expect a steady growth of 1-2 builders per month.
