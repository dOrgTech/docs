# Referral Program

In order to refer someone to dOrg, members should:

1. 1.Have your referral fill out the regular [interest form](https://airtable.com/shr0eQZfACL3Yarac)‚Äã
2. 2.Fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrY4dGORKhV8Rplp) about the referral

The recruitment process is:\
\
**First Round** Interview with the Talent Coordinator to ensure that the candidate is aligned with [our vision, culture](https://docs.dorg.tech), and [the Covenant](https://docs.dorg.tech/covenant).

* If the feedback is positive the Talent Coordinator creates the post in the forum with all the information (email, discord, referrer, interest form, background, work sample, skills and skill level).
* If the feedback is negative, the candidate will receive an email.

**Second Round**This part of the process is divided into two different branches depending if the candidate has a technical or non-technical background

* Technical Interview: 45 minutes with TL to ensure that the profile has the minimum skills that we are looking for based on seniority and stack.

üëâ If the position is for a client project, a member from that team might join to ensure final alignment.üëâ Additional steps may be added if TL consider that a Code Challenge will give a better overview of the candidate. If so, TL needs to provide the Code Challenge to the Talent Acquisition to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and to avoid miscommunication.

* Non-Technical interview: 45 minutes with Coordination Lead to ensure that the profile has the minimum skills that we are looking for based on seniority.

üëâAdditional steps may be add if Coordination Lead considerate that a Business Case will give a better overview of the candidate. If so, the Coordination Lead needs to provide the Business Case to the Talent Acquisition to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and to avoid miscommunication.\
\
**Making a decision**\
****A poll, in the forum, will be created by the Talent Coordinator among the Members involved during the rounds to decide if the candidate is rejected or a proposal is posted in Snapshot.The poll will have the following system:‚õî VETO - strong opinion that the candidate doesn‚Äôt meet the requirements or our Contributor Covenantüò∂ Maybe - didn‚Äôt fell in love with the candidate but open to welcome the person into the organization if his/her skills match with an open positionüòç FAN - strong opinion that the candidate is an asset for dOrg_Rules:_

* It only takes one VETO to reject the candidate. Argument for this vote will be also beneficial so all the people involved can better understand this vote.
* In case of a draw: after a brief discussion those who vote ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù, they will need to change their vote in a second poll for VETO or FAN.
* If in the second poll there isn‚Äôt a clear outcome, the candidate will be rejected.

**Activation/Rejection**\
If the outcome of the poll is positive, the Talent Coordinator will do the post in the Forum and the Snapshot proposal for the final approval of the DAO.
