# Builder Covenant

We as dOrg builders pledge to make participation in our community a positive experience for everyone. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Assuming good intentions
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Encouraging transparency and collaboration while preserving privacy where reasonably expected
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* False accusations or accusations without evidence
* Public or private harassment \(repeated unwanted contact\)
* Spam \(unsolicited off-topic messages\)
* Sexually or violently explicit content
* Retaliatory work stoppage or public defamation
* Silencing others \(e.g. deleting innocuous comments\)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Expectations of professionalism

* Arrive to meetings at their start time
* Respond to client and teammate requests in a timely manner
* Give 2 weeks notice prior to changing your availability on a project

## Scope

This Builder Covenant applies within all dOrg spaces, including our Discord, Alchemy, Github, Google Drive, and all other spaces associated with dOrg. This covenant also applies when an individual is representing dOrg in public spaces, such as using an official email address, social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

Anyone who infringes on this Builder Covenant may be subject to our Escalation Protocol.

## Escalation Protocol

Builders are encouraged to follow these steps if an infringement of our Standards is thought to have occurred:

1. Contact the infringer to reach a private accord if possible. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding or willingness to immediately resolve the situation.
2. If this is not possible, report the infringement to the Experience Facilitator or a dOrg Signer \(top 7 reputation holder\), who can mitigate the immediate situation by removing the relevant comments as necessary.
3. Schedule a mediation with a mutually agreeable arbiter. Mediation gives all affected a chance to share their sides of the story and attempt to reach an accord.
4. If mediation is unsuccessful, any affected party may propose an enforcement action privately outlining evidence of infringement \(such as screenshots\) and proposed consequences with justification. Builders are expected to review the submission, this covenant, and related past disputes in order to make a decision that aligns with the established norms and intention of the community. Possible consequences include:

   | Consequence | Description | Infringement |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | Temporary Ban | Removal from dOrg spaces, no interaction with the people involved, and partial slashing of reputation. After a specified period of time, the infringer can reclaim their slashed reputation and rejoin dOrg spaces by submitting a reactivation request that demonstrates a willingness to admit fault, apologize, rectify actions and avoid similar behavior in the future. | A serious infringement of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. |
   | Indefinite Ban | Removal from dOrg spaces and slashing of all accumulated reputation. | Demonstrating a pattern of infringement of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. |

   If the enforcement proposal fails to pass, then the builder is considered to be in good standing, regains any access to all dOrg spaces, and no further action is necessary.
