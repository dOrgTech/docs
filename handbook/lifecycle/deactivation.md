# Deactivation

Builders can continuously flow in and out of dOrg.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2825%29.png)

## Criteria for Remaining Active

To remain an active dOrg builder, our builders are expected to have, once every quarter:

1. Received a payment; or
2. Voted on one proposal, attended one biweekly sync, and posted once in the forum.

## Exceptional Circumstances

In certain cases, the DAO may pass a proposal to deactivate a builder if they...

* Request to be removed
* Violate any legal agreements or the [Builder Covenant](../governance/covenant.md)
