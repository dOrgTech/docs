At the end of each quarter, builders who haven't met the following criteria will be deactivated:

* Received a payment, or
* Voted on one proposal, attended one biweekly sync, and posted once in the forum

Deactivated builders retain all accumulated reputation and are eligible to reactivate at any time by submitting a proposal.

Builders can be deactivated and slashed of all reputation for violating the [Builder Covenant](covenant.md), subject to the Escalation Protocol therein. Anyone can also choose to deactivate themselves and dispose of all reputation for any reason.
