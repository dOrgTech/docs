Members can be in one of two states:

### **Building** ü§ì üõ†Ô∏è

* Currently working on a project at dOrg (either internal project or client work)
* Full access to Discord and Forum
* Eligible for bonuses

### **Chilling** üòé üèñÔ∏è

* Has not worked on a project in the current quarter but is still willing to support our community&#x20;
* Access to all Discord channels and forum categories other the `Client Projects` sections
* Not eligible for bonuses
* Preserve their email

\
At the end of each quarter, anyone who hasn't earned Rep during that period will be classified as _Chilling._&#x20;

Members who are hired by a dOrg client (with referral fee paid in full by the client to dOrg) automatically gain _Building_ status for 1 year from that transaction.

## Removal Process&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Member can be removed and lose all Rep if they are found to have violated the [Member Covenant](../covenant.md).
{% endhint %}

1. Reach out to have a conversation with anyone that doesn‚Äôt appear to be meeting the Criteria.&#x20;
2. If they‚Äôre non-responsive, or the fit with the dOrg community doesn‚Äôt seem to be working, create a post on the forum sharing which members are being considered for removal and why.
3. Create a Snapshot proposal for removal.
4. Remove user from dOrg.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To remove a member:

1. **Remove all Discord tags**.
2. **Delete Google email account.** As part of the removal process, give the member 7 days notice of deletion so that they can move any important emails or saved documents.
3. **Change Forum access to trust level to 0.** This means that they will no longer have access to private threads.
4. **Remove member's email address from the Members Google Group.** This will remove their calendar invite for the All-Hands meetings and remove access to shared documents.
{% endhint %}
