## Criteria for Remaining Active

At the end of each quarter, builders who haven't met the following criteria will be deactivated:

* Received a payment, or
* Voted on one proposal, attended one biweekly sync, and posted once in the forum

Deactivated builders retain all accumulated reputation and are eligible to reactivate at any time by submitting a proposal.

## Exceptional Circumstances

In certain cases, the DAO may pass a proposal to deactivate a builder if they...

* Request to be removed
* Violate any legal agreements or the [Builder Covenant](covenant.md)
