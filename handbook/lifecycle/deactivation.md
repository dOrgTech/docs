# Deactivation

Builders can continuously flow in and out of dOrg.

## Inactivity Threshold

Any builder that becomes inactive \(does not pass a proposal for 90 days\) is deactivated.

* Removed from shared spaces
* Retains all accumulated tokens
* Can reactivate at any time by passing a proposal

## Exceptional Circumstances

In certain cases, the DAO may pass a proposal to deactivate a builder if they...

* Request to be removed
* Violate any legal agreements or the [Builder Covenant](../governance/covenant.md)
