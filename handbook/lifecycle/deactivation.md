# Deactivation & Reactivation

![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/TrOMR6REnWN1u/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e475olmysndp9wciiouoodkrlec1hne62jdz46l16yp\&rid=giphy.gif\&ct=g)

At the end of each quarter, builders who haven't met the following criteria will be deactivated:

* Received a payment or been involved in an internal project; or
* Voted on one proposal, attended one biweekly sync, and posted once in the forum.

Deactivated builders retain all accumulated Rep and are eligible to reactivate at any time through a proposal. Builders can be deactivated and lose all Rep if they are found to have violated the [Builder Covenant](covenant.md).

## Deactivation Process

1. Reach out to have a conversation with anyone that doesn’t appear to be meeting the Criteria.&#x20;
2. If they’re non-responsive, or the fit with the dOrg community doesn’t seem to be working, create a post on the forum sharing which builders are being considered for deactivation and why.&#x20;
3. Create a proposal for deactivation.

To deactivate a builder:

1. **Remove 'Active Builder' tag on Discord** (along with any skills tags).
2. **Delete Google email account. **As part of the deactivation process, give builder 7 days notice of deletion so that they can move any important emails or saved documents.
3. **Change Forum access to trust level to 0. **This means that they will no longer have access to private threads.
4. **Remove builder's email address from the Active Builders Google Group. **This will remove their calendar invite for the All-Hands meetings and remove access to shared documents.
{% endhint %}

## Reactivation Process

1. Create a Snapshot outlining why you would like to be considered for reactivation.
2. Share this with the community by either DMing an active builder or posting in the public discord channels and tagging @activebuilder.
3. The community will vote on whether to reactivate you.
