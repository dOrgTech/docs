# Deactivation

At the end of each quarter, builders who haven't met the following criteria will be deactivated:

* Received a payment, or
* Voted on one proposal, attended one biweekly sync, and posted once in the forum

Deactivated builders retain all accumulated Rep and are eligible to reactivate at any time through a proposal.

Builders can be deactivated and lose all Rep if they are found to have violated the [Builder Covenant](covenant.md).

## Deactivation Process

When deactivating a builder, ensure that:  
  
1. Their 'active builder' tag on Discord is removed.  
2. Their email is removed from the Google Groups.  
3. Their access to the forum is removed.
