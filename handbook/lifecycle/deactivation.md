We have two types of dOrg members:&#x20;

### **dOrg Builder** 🤓 🛠️

* Currently working on a project at dOrg (either internal project or client work).
* Have full access to Discord and Forum.
* Eligible for bonuses.

### **dOrg Chillers** 😎 🏖️

* Not working but still willing to support our community and/or dOrg as a business.
* Don’t have access to `client-work` Discord category (access to `job-board` granted).
* Access to all forum channels except for the clients thread.
* Not eligible for bonuses (if you are inactive for a period of >3 months).
* Preserve their email.

\
At the end of each quarter, Builders who haven't gained any Rep during that period will be classified as _Chilling._&#x20;

## Deactivation Process&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Builders can be deactivated and lose all Rep if they are found to have violated the [Builder Covenant](covenant.md).
{% endhint %}

1. Reach out to have a conversation with anyone that doesn’t appear to be meeting the Criteria.&#x20;
2. If they’re non-responsive, or the fit with the dOrg community doesn’t seem to be working, create a post on the forum sharing which builders are being considered for deactivation and why.
3. Create a Snapshot proposal for deactivation.
4. Deactivate user from dOrg.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To deactivate a builder:

1. **Remove 'Active Builder' tag on Discord** (along with any skills tags).
2. **Delete Google email account.** As part of the deactivation process, give builder 7 days notice of deletion so that they can move any important emails or saved documents.
3. **Change Forum access to trust level to 0.** This means that they will no longer have access to private threads.
4. **Remove builder's email address from the Active Builders Google Group.** This will remove their calendar invite for the All-Hands meetings and remove access to shared documents.
{% endhint %}
