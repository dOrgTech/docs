# Onboarding

## Interactive Onboarding Forms

Once your activation proposal passes, our Experience Facilitator will send you the onboarding form via email.  
  
Because there’s a fair amount of information we need to give you, we’ve split the onboarding process into two interactive onboarding forms, so that you can work through them in your own time. By the end of this process, you should have a clear understanding of what matters to us, what we expect from our builders, the different internal roles, the client journey from start to finish, the main tools we use, and where to find useful information as you settle into dOrg.

## Orientation Session \(optional\)

Once you've completed the onboarding form, you are welcome to schedule a session with our Experience Facilitator to:

* Walk you through how dOrg works in more detail
* Explore which projects could be a good fit for you
* Get to know your career goals and what kind of work you're looking for
* Have some face-to-face time with a dOrg builder before joining our community calls.

Congrats! If you have reached this point, you are ready to start building with dOrg.
