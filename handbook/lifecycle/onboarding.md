## Interactive Onboarding Forms

Welcome to dOrg!  
  
Because there’s a fair amount of information we need to give you, we’ve split the onboarding process into two interactive onboarding forms so that you can work through them in your own time. By the end of this process, you should have a clear understanding of what matters to us, what we expect from our builders, the different internal roles, the client journey from start to finish, and an overview of our main tools, plus where to find useful information as you settle into dOrg.  
  
**When the collective has voted you in as a new builder, our Experience Facilitator will send you this form via email.**  
  
As part of this form, you will:

* Sign legal docs and submit tax info
* Consent to [our values](https://docs.dorg.tech/overview/our-values) and ****[Builder Covenant](../governance/covenant.md)

## Orientation Session

Once you've completed the onboarding form you're welcome to schedule a session with our Experience Facilitator to:

* Walk you through how dOrg works in more detail, especially our communication channels.
* Explore which projects could be a good fit for you.
* Get to know your career goals and what kind of work you're looking for.
* Have some face-to-face time with at least one dOrg builder before joining our community calls.
