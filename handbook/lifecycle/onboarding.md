## Interactive Onboarding Forms

Welcome to dOrg!  
  
Because there’s a fair amount of information we need to give you, we’ve created an interactive onboarding form so that you can work through it in your own time. By the end of this form, you should have a clear understanding of what matters to us, what we expect from our builders, the different internal roles, the client journey from start to finish, and an overview of our main tools, plus where to find useful information as you settle into dOrg.  
  
When the collective have voted you in as a new builder, our Experience Facilitator will send you this form via email.  
  
As part of this form, you will:

* Sign legal docs and submit tax info
* Consent to [our values](https://docs.dorg.tech/overview/our-values) and ****[Builder Covenant](../governance/covenant.md)

## Orientation Session

If you would like you, once you've completed the onboarding form you're welcome to schedule a session with our Experience Facilitator to:

* Walk you through how dOrg works in more detail
* Find out which projects are the best fit for you
* Answer all of your questions

Congrats! If you have reached this point, you are ready to start building with dOrg.
