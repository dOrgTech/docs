Shortly after your activation proposal passes, you'll get a dOrg email account and Discord access.

Our Experience Facilitator will then send you details of your new email account and a link to an onboarding form that lets you consent to our builder agreements and walks you through the key information and points of reference so that you can confidently join the community from the start.

You'll also have the option to schedule an orientation-focused call to walk through any areas of dOrg you'd like more information on and explore which projects might be the best fit to start.

## Steps to onboard a new builder.

1. **Activation:** Keep an eye on the relevant proposal. Once it's passed, you can start onboarding them. 
2. **dOrg Email and Discord:** Create a @dorg.tech email address for the new builder using his first name or first name and first initial of his surname if there's already an active email with a matching first name. Then find the new builder on Discord \(their Discord handle is requested in the Builder Interest Form, so you should be able to find it on Airtable\), and add the 'active builder' tag, along with relevant skills such as 'front end' or 'design'. 
3. **Welcome Email:** Send the new builder a welcome email \([find the template here](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/onboarding-welcome-email-template/224)\). The welcome email includes all information on accessing Discord for the first time if they haven't shared a Discord handle, their new dOrg email, and a link to the interactive onboarding form. At the end of this form they have the opportunity to book an onboarding-specific call with our Experience Facilitator. If the Experience Facilitator isn't available, there's a section in the template to offer a call with yourself instead.
