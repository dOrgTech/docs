Shortly after your activation proposal passes, you'll get a dOrg email account and Discord access.

Our Experience Facilitator will send you an onboarding form that lets you consent to our builder agreements and review the basics of getting started at dOrg. You'll also have the option to schedule an orientation session to walk through how dOrg works in more detail and explore which projects might be the best fit to start.
