## Proposing Removal

The DAO can vote to remove any member who is found to have infringed the [Member Covenant](../covenant.md). Use the following steps to deal with these incidents:

1. Contact the member to reach a private accord if possible. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding or willingness to immediately resolve the situation.
2. If the situation is time-sensitive, contact the Experience Facilitator or a dOrg Safe Signer to mitigate any immediate harm.
3. Schedule a mediation with a mutually agreeable arbiter. Mediation gives all affected a chance to share their sides of the story and attempt to reach an accord.
4.  If mediation is unsuccessful, any affected party may propose an enforcement action privately outlining evidence of infringement (such as screenshots) and proposed consequences with justification. Members are expected to review the submission, this covenant, and related past disputes in order to make a decision that aligns with the established norms and intention of the community. Possible consequences include:

    | Consequence    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Infringement                                                                                                                                                                                              |

    | Temporary Ban  | Removal from dOrg spaces, no interaction with the people involved, and partial slashing of reputation. After a specified period of time, the infringer can reclaim their slashed reputation and rejoin dOrg spaces by submitting a rejoin request that demonstrates a willingness to admit fault, apologize, rectify actions and avoid similar behavior in the future. | A serious infringement of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.                                                                                                                |
    | Indefinite Ban | Removal from dOrg spaces and slashing of all accumulated reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Demonstrating a pattern of infringement of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. |

    If the enforcement proposal fails to pass, then the member is considered to be in good standing, regains any access to all dOrg spaces, and no further action is necessary.&#x20;

## Requesting Removal

Anyone may have their own membership removed automatically upon request.

### Admin steps for removing a member

When a member requests to be removed or is removed by DAO vote:

* **Remove all Discord tags**.
* **Delete Google email account.** As part of the removal process, give the member 7 days notice of deletion so that they can move any important emails or saved documents.
* **Remove Forum Groups access.** Profile> Admin Settings.&#x20;
* **Change Forum access to trust level to 0.** This means that they will no longer have access to private threads.
* **Create burn transaction** to their address from the dOrg Safe based on their exact Reputation balance.
