# The Swarm & Internal Roles

## The Swarm

One of the best ways to settle into dOrg is to join The Swarm. The Swarm is an umbrella term for small teams of builders that come together to work on internal dOrg tasks, such as building a new app or formulating a new internal process, and then disburse when the task is completed.

To facilitate Swarming, any builder that's working on an internal task as part of The Swarm can log their hours and be paid from dOrg's Swarm Bucket. \
\
The Swarm syncs every Tuesday at 5pm CET in Member Hall.&#x20;

The Swarm is an excellent way to gain insight into and practice being part of a DAO, meeting dOrg builders, and understanding current dOrg focuses and needs. We suggest that all new builders consider joining The Swarm to smoothly onboard as a new community member.

## Internal Roles

We have numerous internal roles that focus on key DAO operations. These roles may dissipate or be created depending on the needs of the DAO.\
\
Current and historical roles include accounting and finance, dOrg's Experience Facilitator, MarComms, and Admin Interface.&#x20;

To facilitate smooth onboarding into dOrg, we bring all builders intending to hold an internal role into The Swarm first. Once experience in being an active community member has been gained, the builder can move into holding the intended internal role.
