# Savings & client payments

dOrg keeps 10% of every client payment to build a reserve that funds internal operations, builder benefits, and new ventures.

## Internal Operations

* Improving and automating workflows
* Creating content
* Activating and onboarding new builders
* External service providers like lawyers, accountants, and SaaS

## Builder Benefits

* Shared services like paid newsletters
* Apparel and other gifts
* [DORG token](rep-and-tokens.md#dorg-tokens) redemptions

## New Ventures

* Anything!

{% hint style="info" %}
The DAO allocates savings through [dOrg Spending Proposals \(DSPs\)](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/tree/master/proposals).

* When creating and voting on DSPâ€™s, check the [DORG RESERVE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwYhzTNXSytzVtACZLu1V_EVTfjPKhGfHu-KhnBFESk/edit#gid=846347915) sheet to see a snapshot of current finances.
* Post the DSP to the general channel for builder feedback.
* Post the proposal to the dOrg DAO with a link to the DSP in github.
