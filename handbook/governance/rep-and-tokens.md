# Voting, Rep & Tokens

## Voting

We use [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth) to create and vote on proposals. Proposals are made for numerous DAO processes, including:

1. Activating new dOrg builders.
2. New internal roles.
3. Governance decisions.

When you connect your wallet to dOrg's Snapshot page for the first time, make sure you use the same Eth address as you do in your profile on the forum so that with your rep is collected in the same wallet as your project payments.

**Watch the below video to see how to make and vote on a simple Snapshot proposal.**

## Reputation \(Rep\)

Reputation translates to **voting power**. Builders currently receive Rep with every dollar earned from the DAO according to the `rep-rate`.

Reputation is **non**-**transferable**, and will always be associated with a **specific wallet address.** Anyone with Rep can **vote** on **proposals** sent to the DAO from their address.

## DORG Tokens

The DORG Token is an [ERC20](../builder-resources/web3-glossary.md#erc20-token) issued by the DAO to track **unpaid obligations**. These tokens compound overtime according to the `interest-rate` \(coming soon!\).
