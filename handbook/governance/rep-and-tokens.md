# Rep & Tokens

## Reputation \(Rep\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

Reputation translates to **voting power**. Builders currently receive Rep with every dollar earned from the DAO according to the `rep-rate`.

Reputation is **non**-**transferable**, and will always be associated with a **specific wallet address.** Anyone with Rep can **vote** on **proposals** sent to the DAO from their address.
