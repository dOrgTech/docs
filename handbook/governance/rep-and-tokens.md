# Voting, Rep & Tokens

## Voting

We use [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth) to create and vote on proposals. Proposals are made for numerous DAO processes, including:

1. Activating new builders
2. Approving new client projects
3. Governance decisions

When you connect your wallet to dOrg's Snapshot page for the first time, make sure you use the same ETH address as you do in your profile on the forum so that with your reputation is collected in the same wallet as your project payments.

**Watch the below video to see how to make and vote on a simple Snapshot proposal.**

## Reputation

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

Reputation translates to voting power and a share economic stake in future airdrops. Builders currently receive 1 reputation point for every dollar earned.

Reputation points are **non**-**transferable**, and will always be associated with a **specific wallet address.** Anyone with reputation can **vote** on **proposals** from their address.

## DXRG Tokens \(deprecated\)

DXRG Tokens were previously used track **unpaid obligations**. Holders may burn their DXRG \(send to 0 address\) for $1 each.
