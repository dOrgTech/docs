# Guiding principles

### As dOrg continues to evolve, our guiding principles are taking root.

Initially an experiment in distributed organisation, we have pioneered governance, legal, and incentive structures that offer our builders \(our members\) the freedom of freelancing with the structural support that comes with being a part of a community of peers.

### Freedom & Support

Enjoy the freedoms of freelancing without sacrificing the support structures of employment.

### Act First, Ask Later

If you want to start or change something, go ahead! Mistakes are usually reversible, so just try things rather than seeking permission.

### Meritocracy

No titles, special privileges, or hierarchical structures. Influence is based on competence and engagement.

### Simple Models

Strive for simplicity over detailed mechanisms. Better to follow high-level principles than low-level procedures.
