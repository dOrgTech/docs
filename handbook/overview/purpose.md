# Our purpose

### dOrg is a full stack Web3 developer collective that is also a DAO \(Decentralised Autonomous Organisation\).

Since early 2019, we have been collaborating with Web3 projects to build infrastructure for the internet of value: DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAO Frameworks, Layer 2s, decentralized identity and reputation standards, data oracles, and developer tools.

[Web3](../builder-resources/web3-glossary.md#web3) is a foundational coordination technology that will empower humans to better their worlds. 

But weâ€™re not there yet. The web3 stack is immature and lacks robust tools and real-world experiments. dOrg spawned at the start of 2019 to change all that.

Our genetic code is simple:

1. **Run on web3.**

   Cultivate a builder collective that utilizes web3 to operate. Develop solutions to challenges along the way.

2. **Build on web3.**

   Execute on projects that advance the stack: digital identity, accountable fundraising, decentralized liquidity, developer tools, friendly UIs.

3. **Iterate and propagate.**

   As web3 matures and gains traction, widen the fold: teachers, journalists, filmmakers, plumbers, nurses, construction workers.
