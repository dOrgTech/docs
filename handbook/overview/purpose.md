Since early 2019, we have been collaborating with projects to advance the Web3 stack. Our genetic code is simple:

1. **Run on web3.**

   Cultivate a builder collective that utilizes web3 to operate. Develop solutions to challenges along the way.

2. **Build on web3.**

   Execute on projects that advance the stack: DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAO frameworks, Layer 2s, decentralized identity and reputation standards, data oracles, developer tools and more.

3. **Iterate and propagate.**

   Continuously iterate our tools and processes to always be coordinating as effectively as possible. Share our methods with the world and help DAOs spread to communities and industries everywhere!
