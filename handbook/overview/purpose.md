Its genetic code is simple:

1. **Build on web3.**

   Collaborate with projects to advance the web3 stack \(DAOs, DeFi, NFTs, L2s, identity, oracles, dev tools\).

2. **Run on web3.**

   Directly utilize the latest web3 tech to operate \(reputation, decision-making, payments, rev-share\).

3. **Iterate and propagate.**

   Adopt new tools and processes to always be coordinating as effectively as possible. Share these methods with communities everywhere.
