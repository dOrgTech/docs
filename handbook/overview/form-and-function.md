# Form & Function

After gestating as a multisig, dOrg mutated into a reputation-weighted [DAO](../glossary/web3.md#dao) with legal personality.

Since then some basic metabolic processes have emerged.

### Activation & Onboarding

New builders are continually [activated](../lifecycle/activation.md) and [onboarded](../lifecycle/onboarding.md) into the DAO. Builders [deactivate](../lifecycle/deactivation.md) after 90 days of inactivity but can always reactivate.

### Core Workflows

Builders collaboratively [find projects](../workflows/finding-a-project.md), [execute on deliverables](../workflows/building.md), and [get paid through the DAO](../workflows/getting-paid.md).

### Governance

The margin on paid projects grow the DAO's [savings](../governance/savings.md), which builders control through [voting and redemption rights](../governance/rep-and-tokens.md) accumulated over time. Builders also govern all legal decisions and [organization-wide variables](../governance/global-variables.md).
