# Creating a React dApp

## Set up initial project structure

There are lots of great initial scaffolding repositories, like [Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth#-scaffold-eth). For a more lightweight CRA scaffolding version, with Typescript and linting configured, and dOrg's preffered libraries check out [React-Dapp-Boilerplate](https://github.com/dOrgTech/react-dapp-boilerplate). Feel free to use the initial structure or scaffolding that best suits your needs
