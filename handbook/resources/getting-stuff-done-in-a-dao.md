# Getting Stuff Done in a DAO

Working in an organization without a chain-of-command can be confusing. Here is a process that can help you translate ideas into reality– whether working on a small project through the Swarm (<40 hr), a DAO-approved grant for larger initiatives, or in the context of a DAO-approved role:

1. **IDENTIFY a problem**. Research how things currently work, find out why they work this way, and discuss with others.
2. **FORMULATE a solution**. Write out a brief description of how you intend to solve the problem and share in a forum post or Github issue for feedback and assistance (unless it’s a small improvement, in which case just go and build). Remember to include:
   * what’s broken
   * why it matters
   * how you plan to fix it.
3. **EXECUTE on the solution**. After getting initial feedback, start executing on your plan– whether it’s setting up a new tool, coding up some utility, crafting a new workflow or guideline, creating a piece of content, or designing a media asset. “Work in public” as much as possible, sharing new versions as you go to keep the feedback-loop tight. The feedback you collect during execution is twofold: on the quality of the solution you’re building, but also on the problem itself. Nobody wants to spend valuable time on building a great tool that nobody needs.
4. **MERGE the solution into existing workflows**. Just because you built something awesome that solves an existing problem, it doesn’t mean anyone will use it! In addition to sharing updates in the usual channels, there are several important ways to get your changes integrated into day-to-day realities and workflows of the organization:
   * Make a PR to the the handbook and/or landing page Post a demo video
   * Organize a walkthrough call with specific people, at a Swarm sync or an All-Hands call
   * Ask dOrg’s People Ops or Marketing specialists to make a post in the Discord announcements channel and in the next newsletter
   * Setup metrics that measure whether the solution is working and schedule checkpoints to check progress and make adjustments

Getting feedback does NOT mean requesting formal sign-off or an official vote.

Only initiate a DAO proposal before step 3 if you expect your efforts to exceed the swarm scope (>40 hrs).

Only initiate a DAO proposal before step 4 if the change has structural, legal, or financial implications for the organization. Keep in mind that while proposals can formally certify the DAO’s stance, they don’t automatically imply that people will adopt the intended behavior. Step 4 is crucial for deep behavioral changes.
