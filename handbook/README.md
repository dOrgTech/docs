### What is dOrg?

dOrg is an autonomous collective of engineers, designers, and other web3 specialists. We build tools that empower people to self-organize.

We envision a future where power is radically decentralized – people can easily coordinate and transact without intermediaries; institutions are transparent and responsive to the needs of their constituents; voluntary collectives outcompete coercive monopolies; wealth is shared by those who create it; and machines handle the boring work while humans focus on meaningful pursuits.

We believe that web3 will be a key part of this future and we’re here to build it.

### Strategy

To achieve our mission we will become:

* **The best place to up-skill on web3 development** by helping proven builders to hone their craft, find community, earn a living, and cultivate autonomy while working on bleeding edge technology.
* **The premier provider of web3 development services** by serving as a one-stop-shop for promising projects to accelerate development and adoption with minimal friction.
* **The best example of a web3 organization** by iterating on our methods and sharing them widely to help millions of autonomous collectives bloom.

### Values

In this pursuit, we’re guided by a pragmatic set of shared values:

* **Autonomous Action** - We encourage each member to pursue initiatives in good faith without seeking approval or waiting for others to act.
* **Transparency** - We guarantee all members equal access to organizational information, including financial data, legal documents, and internal processes.
* **Participatory Meritocracy** - We distribute rewards and governance rights to members based on value contributed, not titles or hierarchy.
* **Inclusion & Respect** - We foster a diverse membership and support one another in maintaining a healthy digital workplace.
