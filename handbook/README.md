We are working to realize the web3 vision of a decentralized internet that empowers individuals and communities everywhere.

### What is our strategy?

1. Carefully curate the builders we onboard and projects we work with
2. Reevaluate and upgrade our tools and processes regularly
3. Tell our story and share our methods widely
