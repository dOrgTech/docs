### What is dOrg?

dOrg is an autonomous collective of engineers, designers, and other web3 specialists. We build tools that empower people to self-organize.

We envision a future where power is radically decentralized – people can easily coordinate and transact without intermediaries; institutions are transparent and responsive to their constituents; self-governing collectives outcompete coercive monopolies; ownership is widely distributed; and machines handle the boring work while humans focus on meaningful pursuits.

We believe that web3 will be a key part of this future and we’re here to build it.

### How?

dOrg simultaneously serves as a...

* **Community for talented builders** to earn, learn, and cultivate autonomy while working on bleeding edge tech;
* **Service provider for high-potential projects** to accelerate development with minimal friction; and
* **Open-source template** for aspiring collectives to fork and iterate upon.

Several mutually-reinforcing feedback loops propel our progress:

### Our Values

* **Autonomous Action** - We encourage each other to pursue initiatives in good faith rather than waiting for others to act or seeking approval.
* **Transparency** - We guarantee all members equal access to organizational information, including financial data, legal documents, and internal processes.
* **Participatory Meritocracy** - We distribute governance rights and rewards based on value contributed, not titles or hierarchy.
* **Inclusion & Respect** - We foster a diverse membership and support one another in maintaining a healthy digital workplace.
