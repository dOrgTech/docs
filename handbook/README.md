# Welcome to dOrg!

### What is dOrg?

dOrg is an autonomous collective of engineers, designers, and other web3 specialists. We build tools that empower people to self-organize.

We envision a future where power is radically decentralized – people can easily coordinate and transact without intermediaries; institutions are transparent and responsive to the needs of their constituents; self-governing collectives outcompete coercive monopolies; wealth is fairly distributed; and machines handle the boring work while humans focus on meaningful pursuits.

We believe that web3 will be a key part of this future and we’re here to build it.

### Our Strategy

To achieve our mission we will become:

* **The best place for web3 builders to upskill** by honing their craft, finding community, earning a living, and cultivating autonomy while working on bleeding edge technology.
* **The premier provider of web3 development services** by serving as a one-stop-shop for promising projects to accelerate development and adoption with minimal friction.
* **The best example of a web3 organization** by iterating on our methods and sharing them widely to help millions of autonomous collectives bloom.

### Our Values

* **Autonomous Action** - We encourage each other to pursue initiatives in good faith rather than waiting for others to act or seeking approval.
* **Transparency** - We guarantee all members equal access to organizational information, including financial data, legal documents, and internal processes.
* **Participatory Meritocracy** - We distribute governance rights and rewards based on value contributed, not titles or hierarchy.
* **Inclusion & Respect** - We foster a diverse membership and support one another in maintaining a healthy digital workplace.
