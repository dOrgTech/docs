We are working to realize the web3 vision of a decentralized internet that empowers individuals and communities everywhere.

### What is our strategy?

1. Carefully curate the builders we onboard and projects we work with
2. Regularly upgrade our tools and processes
3. Share our methods widely and build bridges to other communities
