# Governance

### Flow of Funds 💸

dOrg members work in small teams to execute on client projects. Projects distribute their income amongst the execution team, sourcing lead, and dOrg's treasury.

### Treasury 🏦

The treasury funds [internal initiatives](workflows/doing-internal-work.md#the-swarm), [internal roles](workflows/doing-internal-work.md#internal-roles), and shared expenses.

### Reputation 🏅

Members receive one unit of [Rep](https://etherscan.io/token/0x62300cec5240e5b273781ad67ce735107f3dacd4#balances) for every dollar earned from dOrg projects. Rep units are non-transferable and represent a share of _voting power_ and _token bonuses_.&#x20;

### Voting 🗳

Rep enables members to govern the treasury spending, membership approvals, client project approvals, and more through Snapshot proposals ([see more details here](workflows/navigating.md#snapshot)).

### Bonuses 🤑

Rep also grants members a proportional share of token bonuses from client projects. Currently we flush all tokens (other than ETH and stablecoins) from the treasury to eligible members in proportion to the square root of their rep-holdings at the end of each quarter.
