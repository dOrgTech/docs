# Governance

## Value Flow

Each project team receives payments directly from the client to a Gnosis Safe that it controls. The team distributes these funds to its builders \(80%\), sourcing lead \(10%\), and dOrg's shared treasury \(10%\).

## Reputation

Builders receive 1 reputation point for every dollar earned from dOrg projects. Reputation points represent a share of **voting** power and future **airdrops**.

Reputation points are non-transferable, and hence associated with a specific wallet address. Make sure to consistently use the same wallet address across all dOrg projects so that your reputation accumulates in the same wallet.

## Voting

Anyone with reputation can create and vote on proposals in [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth). Proposals are used to approve new builders, client projects, budgeting decisions and more.

## Airdrops \(coming soon\)

Reputation also grants builders a share of dOrg's token airdrops. More on this soon!

## DXRG Tokens \(deprecated\)

DXRG Tokens were previously used track **unpaid obligations**. Holders may burn their DXRG \(send to 0 address\) for $1 each.
