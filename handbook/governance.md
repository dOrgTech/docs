### Flow of Funds

dOrg builders work in small teams to execute on client projects. Projects distribute their income among the execution team, sourcing lead\(s\), and dOrg's treasury.

### Treasury

Builders use dOrg's treasury to fund shared expenses, ongoing roles, and internal initiatives. The current breakdown of these categories is reflected below:

* _Shared Expenses_ **-** SaaS, legal, accounting, taxes
* _Ongoing Roles_ - facilitation, bookkeeping & QA, admin interface, markcomms, sales ops
* _Internal Initiatives_ - dev standards, landing page, mechanism design

### Reputation

Builders receive 1 [rep token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x62300cec5240e5b273781ad67ce735107f3dacd4#balances) for every dollar earned from dOrg projects. Rep tokens are non-transferable and represent a share of _voting power_ and _future airdrops_. 

### Voting

Anyone with reputation can create and vote on proposals in [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth). Proposals are used to govern the treasury, builder activation, client project approval, and more.

### Airdrops \(coming soon\)

Reputation also grants builders a share of dOrg's token airdrops. More on this soon!

### DXRG Tokens \(deprecated\)

[DXRG Tokens](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tokens/0x76D37cbB1fD75912bfB0cE885c506C77955F5C05/token-transfers) were previously used track unpaid obligations. Holders may redeem their DXRG for $1 each.
