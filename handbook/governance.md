# Governance

### Flow of Funds

dOrg builders work in small teams to execute on client projects. Projects distribute their income amongst the execution team, sourcing lead, and dOrg's treasury.

### Treasury

The treasury funds _ongoing roles_ (e.g. facilitator, marketing lead, sales ops lead), _internal initiatives_ (working groups, website maintenance, new ventures), and _shared expenses_ (SaaS, legal, accounting).

### Reputation

Builders receive one [Rep token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x62300cec5240e5b273781ad67ce735107f3dacd4#balances) for every dollar earned from dOrg projects. Rep tokens are non-transferable and represent a share of _voting power_ and _airdrops_.&#x20;

### Voting

Rep enables builders to govern the treasury, builder activations, client projects approvals, Rep issuance and more through [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth) proposals.

### Bonuses

Rep also grants builders a proportional share of token bonuses from client projects. More on this soon!

### DXRG (deprecated)

[DXRG Tokens](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tokens/0x76D37cbB1fD75912bfB0cE885c506C77955F5C05/token-transfers) were previously used track unpaid obligations ([see redemption instructions here](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/deprecating-dxrg-debt-tokens/209)).
