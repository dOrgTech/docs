# Governance

![](<.gitbook/assets/flow of funds - feb 22 (2).png>)

### Project Multisigs 🔐

dOrg members work in small teams to execute on client projects. Each team has its own wallet for collecting and distributing revenue amongst the sourcing lead(s), execution team, and dOrg's treasury.

### Treasury 🏦

The treasury is used to fund internal [roles](workflows/doing-internal-work.md#internal-roles), [initiatives](workflows/doing-internal-work.md#the-swarm), and [organizational expenses](workflows/expense-reimbursement-policy.md).

### Reputation 🏅

Members receive one unit of [Rep](https://etherscan.io/token/0x62300cec5240e5b273781ad67ce735107f3dacd4#balances) for every dollar earned from dOrg. Rep units are non-transferable and represent a share of _voting power_ and _token bonuses_.&#x20;

### Voting 🗳

Rep enables members to govern the treasury spending, membership approvals, client project approvals, and more through Snapshot proposals ([see more details here](workflows/navigating.md#snapshot)).

### Bonuses 🤑

Rep also grants members a proportional share of token bonuses from client projects. At the end of each quarter, we flush all tokens (other than ETH and stablecoins) from the treasury to eligible members in proportion to their Rep.
