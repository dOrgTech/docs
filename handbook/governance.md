### Flow of Funds

dOrg builders work in small teams to execute on client projects. Projects distribute their income among the execution team, sourcing lead\(s\), and dOrg's treasury.

### Treasury

The [treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xdb22d2d37db92EA7fa6993C9f6Ead55FBb1eF4EA) funds shared expenses, ongoing roles, and internal initiatives \(examples below\)

* _Shared Expenses_ **-** SaaS, legal, accounting, taxes
* _Ongoing Roles_ - facilitation, bookkeeping & QA, admin interface, markcomms, sales ops
* _Internal Initiatives_ - dev standards, landing page, mechanism design

### Reputation

Builders receive 1 [Rep token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x62300cec5240e5b273781ad67ce735107f3dacd4#balances) for every dollar earned from dOrg projects. Rep tokens are non-transferable and represent a share of _voting power_ and _future airdrops_. 

### Voting

Builders create and vote on proposals in [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth) to govern the treasury, builder activations, client projects approvals, Rep issuance and more.

### Airdrops \(coming soon\)

Rep also grants builders a share of dOrg's token airdrops. More on this soon!

### DXRG Tokens \(deprecated\)

[DXRG Tokens](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tokens/0x76D37cbB1fD75912bfB0cE885c506C77955F5C05/token-transfers) were previously used track unpaid obligations. Each DXRG can be redeemed for one dollar.
