It is the builder's responsibility to make sure to understand the compensation model for each client and internal project. Ask Experience Facilitator for help if you don't find the information.&#x20;

## The Swarm

{% hint style="warning" %}
All Forum links go to our private sections. So, only dOrg members have access.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

One of the best ways to settle into dOrg is to join [The Swarm](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/swarm-bucket/237). The Swarm is an umbrella term for small teams that come together to work on initiatives that improve dOrg, such as building a new dashboard or improving an internal process, and then disburse when the initiative is completed.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Swarm is an excellent way to gain insight into and practice being part of a DAO, meeting dOrg members, and understanding current dOrg focuses and needs. We suggest that newcomers stop by the weekly Swarm sync to learn how they can contribute.

## Internal Roles

At any given time, we have several part-time roles that lead key operational areas.  Anyone may propose to dissipate or create a new role based on dOrg's needs.

See here for the current breakdown of roles:
