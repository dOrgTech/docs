# Doing Internal Work

## The Swarm

![](https://i.gifer.com/4dau.gif)

One of the best ways to settle into dOrg is to join [The Swarm](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/swarm-bucket/237). The Swarm is an umbrella term for small teams of builders that come together to work on initiatives that improve dOrg, such as building a new dashboard or improving an internal process, and then disburse when the initiative is completed.

The Swarm is an excellent way to gain insight into and practice being part of a DAO, meeting dOrg builders, and understanding current dOrg focuses and needs. We suggest that all new builders consider joining The Swarm to smoothly onboard as a new community member.

## Internal Roles

At any given time, we have several part-time roles that lead key operational areas, such as marketing, accounting, legal, talent acquisition, builder experience, and client experience.  Anyone may propose to dissipate or create a new role based on dOrg's needs.

{% hint style="success" %}
To facilitate smooth onboarding into dOrg, we bring all builders intending to hold an internal role into The Swarm first. Once experience in being an active community member has been gained, the builder can move into holding the intended internal role.

The Swarm and all Internal Roles sync every Tuesday at 5pm CET in the Discord Member Hall.
