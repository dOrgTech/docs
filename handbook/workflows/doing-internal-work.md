# Doing Internal Work

## The Swarm

{% hint style="warning" %}
All Forum links go to our private sections. So, only dOrg members have access.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

One of the best ways to settle into dOrg is to join [The Swarm](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/swarm-bucket/237). The Swarm is an umbrella term for small teams that come together to work on initiatives that improve dOrg, such as building a new dashboard or improving an internal process, and then disburse when the initiative is completed.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Swarm is an excellent way to gain insight into and practice being part of a DAO, meeting dOrg members, and understanding current dOrg focuses and needs. We suggest that newcomers stop by the weekly Swarm sync to learn how they can contribute.

## Internal Roles

At any given time, we have several part-time roles that lead key operational areas.  Anyone may propose to dissipate or create a new role based on dOrg's needs.

See here for the current breakdown of roles:

| Name                                                                            | Role                | Description                                                                                                                           |

{% hint style="success" %}
New members who intend to hold an internal role should start off by contributing through the Swarm. Once you have gained experience with the responsibilities and what it's like to work in the DAO, you can post a proposal for the role in the forum.

The Swarm and all Internal Roles sync every Tuesday at 5pm CET/ 11am EST in the Discord Member Hall. Find your calendar invitation on your Google Cal.&#x20;
