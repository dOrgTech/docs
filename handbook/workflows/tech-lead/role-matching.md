# Role Matching

### Finding a role as a builder

Our builders have two main places to check regularly when looking for a new role.

1. The [Job Board](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/about-the-job-board-category) in the forum, where our PMs and Tech Leads will sometimes post about their talent need.
2. You should also keep an eye on the [Client Project](https://forum.dorg.tech/c/clientproject) section in the forum as PMs and Tech Leads will note talent needs in their project thread.

Our Experience Facilitator also shares information about builders looking for roles, so DM anna-marie on Discord whenever you're looking for a role and she will add your skills and current availability.

### Matching a talent need as a PM or Tech Lead

You can find a builder to match your talent need by:

1. Searching in the [forum](https://forum.dorg.tech/) using the search bar. You can search by technologies a builder is proficient in, their skills, the name of a past dOrg project, experience levels: basically, any of the information in the forum profiles.

2. Posting details about the client project and your talent needs in the [job board](https://forum.dorg.tech/c/job-board/9).  
3. Adding your need to your particular [client project](https://forum.dorg.tech/c/clientproject) thread.
