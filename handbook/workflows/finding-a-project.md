# Building on client projects

## Finding a project to join

Check out the [https://forum.dorg.tech/](https://forum.dorg.tech/) to learn details about our ongoing projects and express interest in any with open spots by commenting on the thread.

Get briefed by the PM and Tech Lead on the state of the project and how you can contribute. In the project's forum post, you can see all the key details needed to contribute effectively.

## Building on a project

Here's what it takes to build with dOrg:

1. Attend weekly syncs prepared and on-time
2. Send updates and questions to the rest of the team and client as you build
3. Self-assign issues, include clear code comments and commit messages and comments your code, commit early and often, avoid massive PRs, write tests,  and follow the rest of dOrg's &lt;coding standards&gt;
4. Log your work and time in the project's budget spreadsheet before each payment checkpoint
5. At each payment checkpoint, review your teammates' logs and sign-off on the transaction initiated by the PM

## Communication



* **Calls**. The team has weekly internal syncs followed by client-facing calls to report progress and discuss issues.
* **Chats**. The team uses a corresponding Discord channel for internal communications and usually has an external channel open with the client on their platform of choice \(Slack/Telegram/Discord\)
* **Project Boards.** The team tracks its progress on project boards in Github or similar
