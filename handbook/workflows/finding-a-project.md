# Building on client projects

Once onboarded, you are qualified to start contributing to our ongoing projects.

## Finding a project to join

1. Express interest in any of our ongoing [Client Projects](https://forum.dorg.tech/c/clientproject/8) by commenting on the thread.
2. If the PM and Tech Lead of that project determine that your skills and availability match the project's needs, they will reach out to schedule a walkthrough.
3. If it's a match, the PM will update the project's post with your start date, time commitment, and role.

## Contributing to a project

1. Familiarize yourself with the project details noted in its forum post \(code repos, project boards, SoW, QA Worksheet, etc.\).
2. Attend weekly syncs. Make sure you are prepared and join a few minutes early with a stable internet connection and good audio.
3. Self-assign issues in the project board while communicating with other builders to avoid overlap and ensuring you are working on the highest priority tasks.
4. Log your work and time in the project's budget spreadsheet before each payment checkpoint.
5. At each payment checkpoint, review your teammates' logs and sign-off on the transaction initiated by the PM.
6. Participate in periodic retro sessions and feedback surveys initiated by the PM

### **Tips & Tricks**

* Share updates and questions with the rest of the team as you build.
* Include clear commit messages and code comments, commit early and often, avoid massive PRs, write tests, and leverage &lt;dOrg's coding best practices&gt;.
* If you run into any issues, technical or otherwise, ask other builders for help. If the problem persists, tap into the dOrg hive mind by posting in the \#help channel on Discord.
* If you feel that a project is going over scope or needs more time, discuss this with the Tech Lead or PM as soon as possible so that adjustments can be made.
