# Navigating our channels

## Forum

The dOrg forum hosts discussions about talent needs, new builders, client projects, internal initiatives, and diff governance topics. When a decision needs to be made, anyone can create a proposal in Snapshot \(see below\) that links to the relevant forum post.

Watch the below video to run through our main forum categories.

{% hint style="info" %}
During sign-up to the forum, you'll be asked to add a profile picture. Please upload a professional headshot. This profile picture will be added to our builder section on the dOrg website so please make this a high-resolution profile shot with an un-busy background and in square ratio. You're welcome to add a friendly and well-designed avatar if you'd prefer.
{% endhint %}

The forum is also the best place to find [projects to work](https://forum.dorg.tech/c/clientproject/) or to find [builders to join a project](https://forum.dorg.tech/u/). Simply click on anyone's profile image to view their profile details, or use the search functionality at the top right.

  
Here's what our Experience Facilitator's profile looks like:

**Profiles are set up when joining the forum for the first time.** However, your peers will use the details in your profile to search for their talent needs, so please make sure you keep your profile updated.

## Snapshot

Once proposals have gone through a dialogue process in the forum, they are posted to Snapshot for a formal vote by the DAO. Your voting weight corresponds to your [rep score](../governance.md#reputation).

Head to [Snapshot's Handbook](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals) if you need further assistance.
{% endhint %}

## Discord

Discord is where day-to-day chat on internal projects and client projects happens. It's also where [sourcing leads](https://docs.dorg.tech/workflows/sourcing) review incoming client project requests, where you will find a running list of snapshot proposals, and where you can ask for help from peers if you are stumped on an issue or would like feedback.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've never used Discord before, [watch this beginner's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYGrq95ezA&ab_channel=Howfinity).

Then [use this link to join the dOrg server](https://discord.gg/6X8bedvKkQ) and access our public channels.

Click on the down arrow next to 'dorg' at the top of the screen and add a Discord nickname.
