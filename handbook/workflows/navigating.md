# Navigating our Channels

## Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bA9ZM7WXZU) is where all of our day-to-day chat happens. Each client project or internal initiative has its own channel, and we also have dedicated channels for social topics, governance functions, and finding help.

The voice channel in Discord hosts our biweekly All-Hands call, where we present project demos, tech talks, and upcoming opportunities.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've never used Discord before, [watch this beginner's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYGrq95ezA\&ab\_channel=Howfinity).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Select a nickname that is consistent with your first name or handle in the dOrg forum to make yourself easier to find. You can set a nickname by selecting the down arrow next to 'dOrg' at the top left, and then 'Change Nickname'.
{% endhint %}

## Forum

{% hint style="warning" %}
All Forum links go to our private sections. So, only dOrg members have access.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The dOrg forum hosts discussions about talent needs, new members, client projects, internal initiatives, and other governance topics. When a decision needs to be made, anyone can post a proposal to Snapshot (see below) that links to the relevant forum post.

The forum is the best place to find a project to work on. Go to the [client projects section](https://forum.dorg.tech/c/clientproject) and click through to see which ones have open roles.

The forum is also a great place to find members to join a project. Go to the [member list](https://forum.dorg.tech/u/) and click on anyone's profile image to view their profile details. You can also [use the search feature to find members](https://forum.dorg.tech/search?search\_type=users) by skills, technologies, past projects, and experience level.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Profiles are set up when joining the forum for the first time.** Keep your profile up-to-date so that others can easily search you for their project needs.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Don't forget to upload a professional headshot or well-designed avatar to your profile. This picture will be displayed on dOrg's website, so make sure it's a high-res square image with an un-busy background.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to use the ETH address provided in your profile across all dOrg projects so that your reputation accumulates in one place.
{% endhint %}

## Snapshot

Once proposals have gone through a dialogue process in the forum, they are posted to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth) for a [reputation-weighted](../governance.md#reputation) vote.

The following conditions must be met for a Snapshot proposals to be legitimate:

* link to a post on [forum.dOrg.tech](https://forum.dorg.tech) (and backlink the forum post to the snapshot proposal)
* at least 5 day voting window
* at least 5 participating votes

Head to [Snapshot's Handbook](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals) if you need further assistance.
{% endhint %}

## Google Workspace

We use Google Workspace for our internal documents, spreadsheets, forms, etc. \
To agile work flows when creating general interest new documents, please make sure to set up permissions to dOrg members.
