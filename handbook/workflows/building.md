## **Project Sourcing Guide**

## **Response Email**

Here is an email template for responding to inbound inquiries from potential clients:  


_Hi \[Name\],_

_Thanks so much for your interest in hiring our builder collective. Your submission caught our eye and we'd love to meet with you. We'll discuss your project more in depth and tell you what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg._

_ðŸ¤™**Please schedule a call with me at your earliest. \[Your calendar link\]**_

_In the meantime, please prepare an outline of your projectâ€™s requirements that we can review on the call._

_Looking forward to meeting with you!_

_Cheers,  
\[Your Name\]_

## Client Screening Call

The goal of the screening call is to assess the clientâ€™s fit for dOrg and help them understand what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg. 

Here are some questions to guide your call:

_How did you hear about dOrg?  
Tell me about the project  
What does the team currently look like?  
What is the current tech stack?  
What are your top needs?  
What is your ideal timeframe? How flexible is this?  
Do you have a project requirements doc that you could send?  
Do you have any other questions about what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg?_

## Builder Interest Call & Team Formation

The next step is to gather interested builders and schedule a technical Q&A with the client.

1. Post in [Client Projects](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/about-the-client-projects-category/19) in the dOrg forum, following the instructions on the pinned post.
2. Each project is required to have a PM and a Tech Lead \(see Forming a Team below\)
3. Schedule a call with the client and all interested builders. Make sure that the builders review available materials so that they can be prepared to ask questions during the call.

_In addition to a well-balanced set of builders that match the projectâ€™s needs, each team must have one Tech Lead and one Project Manager. The DAO governs who has these badges._

**Tech Lead:** 

1. Owns the code quality and is responsible for making sure there are no quality issues, that the coding standards are being followed. 
2. Ensures that thereâ€™s a good fit between the builders and their technical responsibilities.

**Project Manager:** 

1. Responsible for managing communication with the client
2. Processes builder payouts
3. Monitors builder hour logs, scope load and deadlines

## SoW & Invoicing

If the interested builders agree that the project looks promising, does not have major technical issues or execution risks, and that they have the availability and skills to take on the engagement, then proceed with the following.

1. Create SoW on [Pandadoc](https://app.pandadoc.com/a/#/templates-next?sortBy=name&direction=asc&displayMode=folders_first&mainFilter=all)
   * Login
   * Username: accounting@dorg.tech
   * Password: 3k@PJwzyRpyi2G
   * Go to Templates, hover over â€˜dOrg SoW Templateâ€™, and click â€˜Create Documentâ€™
2. Share the draft SoW in the Discourse thread with the interested builders, confirming that the term, pricing, and scope look reasonable.
   * Notes re: token allocation norms - 
   * For pre-launch tokens, this can be specified as a % of token supply or absolute number of tokens with vesting/lock-up terms.
   * If the client's token is already launched and liquid, structure a regular bonus denominated in the client's native token.
3. Send to client through PandaDoc. Revise if reasonable and necessary based on the clientâ€™s feedback.
4. Once the client has signed, to submit a proposal to the DAO through Snapshot
5. Once the proposal passes, create a Gnosis Safe for the project with all team members as signers
6. Invoice the client via [Gilded](https://app.gilded.finance/auth/login), making the invoice recurring unless not appropriate for this projectâ€™s cycle
