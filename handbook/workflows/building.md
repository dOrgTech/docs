# Building

Each project has one or more builders executing on deliverables and coordinating delivery.

## As an executor

Execution ultimately determines project outcomes. That's why a bias towards action is essential, including:

* **Communication.** Proactively update other builders in the internal chat \(Discord\), speak-up when needed in the client chat \(Telegram\), and attend weekly calls.
* **Organization.** Keep issues and project boards \(Github\) up-to-date with your progress.
* **Execution.** Complete deliverables by the agreed to deadlines.

### **Tips & Tricks**

* Keep a log of hours worked and contributions made as you go. This will reduce time and avoid conflict at payment checkpoints.
* Regularly check-in with your squad to ensure that everyone is fulfilling their work allocations. Builder self-organization is how dOrg delivers quality work on time.
* If you run into any issues, technical or otherwise, ask your squad for help. If the problem persists, tap into the dOrg hive mind by posting in the \#help channel on Discord.
* If you feel that a project is going over scope or needs more time, discuss this with your coordinator as soon as possible so that adjustments can be made.

## As a coordinator

The coordinator is responsible for keeping the project on track. This includes setting up and maintaining:

* **Weekly Calls**. Share progress, discuss issues, and realign priorities between the client and builder squad.
* **Chats**. Internal builder chat \(Discord\) and client chat \(Telegram\).
* **Project Boards.** In Github or similar to track the status of each deliverable.
* **Invoices & Payments**. Send client invoices and and facilitate builder payments at preset checkpoints.

### Kickoff

Start strong by arranging a kickoff call with the builder squad to:

* Confirm that the **scope of work** and **deadlines** are realistic. If not, discuss and adjust with the client.
* Divide up expected **work allocations** according to skills and availability.
* Setup the **budget spreadsheet** based on previous project templates \(see [Getting Paid](getting-paid.md)\)

As coordinator, you are the client's **primary point of contact**. Make sure to regularly check-in with the squad and update the client!
