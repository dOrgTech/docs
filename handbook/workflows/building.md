# Sourcing new client projects

## **Response Email**

Here is an email template for responding to inbound inquiries from potential clients:

> _Hi \[Name\],_
>
> _Thanks so much for your interest in hiring our builder collective. Your submission caught our eye and we'd love to meet with you. We'll discuss your project more in depth and tell you what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg._
>
> _ðŸ¤™**Please schedule a call with me at your earliest. \[Your calendar link\]**_
>
> _In the meantime, please prepare an outline of your projectâ€™s requirements that we can review on the call._
>
> _Looking forward to meeting with you!_
>
> _Cheers,  
> \[Your Name\]_

## Client Screening Call

The goal of the screening call is to assess the clientâ€™s fit for dOrg and help them understand what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg. 

Here are some questions to guide your call:

* _How did you hear about dOrg?_
* _Tell me about the project_
* _What does the team currently look like?_
* _What is the current tech stack?_
* _What are your top needs?_
* _What is your ideal timeframe? How flexible is this?_
* _Do you have a project requirements doc that you could send?_
* _Do you have any other questions about what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg?_

## Team Formation

The next step is to gather interested builders and schedule a technical Q&A with the client.

1. Post in [Client Projects](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/about-the-client-projects-category/19) in the dOrg forum, following the instructions on the pinned post.
2. Schedule a call with the client and all interested builders. Make sure that the builders review available materials so that they can be prepared to ask questions during the call.

In addition to a well-balanced set of builders that match the projectâ€™s needs, each team must have a [Project Manager](pm.md) and [Tech Lead](being-tech-lead.md)
{% endhint %}

## SoW & Invoicing

If the interested builders agree that the project looks promising, does not have major technical issues or execution risks, and that they have the availability and skills to take on the engagement, then proceed with the following.

1. Create SoW on [Pandadoc](https://app.pandadoc.com/a/#/templates-next?sortBy=name&direction=asc&displayMode=folders_first&mainFilter=all). Go to Templates, hover over â€˜dOrg SoW Templateâ€™, and click â€˜Create Documentâ€™ \([see login credentials here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QXB9Ski8OxHRiELfxq8DcahYFhNnEKPEM20kRjeuYA/edit?usp=sharing)\)
2. Share the draft SoW in the Discourse thread with the interested builders, confirming that the term, pricing, and scope look reasonable.
   * Notes re: token allocation norms - 
   * For pre-launch tokens, this can be specified as a % of token supply or absolute number of tokens with vesting/lock-up terms.
   * If the client's token is already launched and liquid, structure a regular bonus denominated in the client's native token.
3. Send to client through PandaDoc. Revise if reasonable and necessary based on the clientâ€™s feedback.
4. Once the client has signed, to submit a proposal to the DAO through Snapshot
5. Once the proposal passes, create a Gnosis Safe for the project with all team members as signers
6. Invoice the client via [Gilded](https://app.gilded.finance/auth/login), making the invoice recurring unless not appropriate for this projectâ€™s cycle \([see login credentials here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QXB9Ski8OxHRiELfxq8DcahYFhNnEKPEM20kRjeuYA/edit?usp=sharing)\)
   * Login &gt; Contacts &gt; Add Contact &gt; 
   * Accounts &gt; Add Account &gt; Input address &gt; Account Name is the Project Name &gt; Wallet Address is the dOrg multi-sig for this specific project
   * Payments &gt; Invoices &gt; Recurring &gt; New Recurring Invoice &gt; Set the details \([view example here](https://app.gilded.finance/invoice/view/mDNglRQ0kMtaLDxwjvms)\), and check the box to automatically email invoice to customer.  \*\*In the notes field, make sure to enter the payment instructions: Payable in DAI.
7. Continue to invoice on the agreed upon schedule and monitor the project through the PM, making sure to step in and help resolve any issues that arise.
