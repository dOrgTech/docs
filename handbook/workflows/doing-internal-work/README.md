# Doing Internal Work

{% hint style="info" %}
It is the builder's responsibility to make sure to understand the compensation model for each client and internal project. Ask Experience Facilitator for help if you don't find the information.&#x20;

All Forum links go to our private sections. So, only dOrg members have access.&#x20;

## **The Swarm**

dOrg is a dev collective working primarily on external projects. However, being an organization, it also requires internal work to properly function and grow. This goes from building a new dashboard to improving internal processes, from working on business development to creating new tools that increase builders' satisfaction.

Internal work is done through [The Swarm](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/swarm-bucket/237). The Swarm is an umbrella term for small teams that come together to work on internal initiatives, and then disburse when the initiative is completed.

Internal work in The Swarm is divided in three categories:

* **capped, permission-less work**: every builder can work **up to 22 hours each month** on whatever they think needs to be done, without asking for permission; it's still highly recommended to follow the principles outlined in the [getting stuff done in a DAO](../../resources/getting-stuff-done-in-a-dao.md) to be sure to not waste time
* **internal roles**: in some specific instances, dOrg can vote to create part-time roles that lead key operational areas, like Talent, or Marcom; these roles are not subjected to the 22h/m cap
* **funded initiatives (grants)**: every builder who needs to go over the 22h/m cap can propose a funded initiative to the DAO; such initiatives need to be properly aligned to dOrg strategic objectives, and their progress needs to be measured and reviewed during the initiative lifecycle. A thorough description of **how to request** dOrg to **fund** an internal project can be found [**here**](funded-initiatives.md)****

The Swarm is an excellent way to gain insight into and practice being part of a DAO, meeting dOrg members, and understanding current dOrg focuses and needs. We suggest that newcomers stop by the weekly Swarm sync to learn how they can contribute.

See our guide on [getting stuff done in a DAO](../../resources/getting-stuff-done-in-a-dao.md) for general guidance.

## Internal Roles

At any given time, we have several part-time roles that lead key operational areas. Anyone may propose to dissipate or create a new role based on dOrg's needs.

{% hint style="success" %}
New members who intend to hold an internal role should start off by contributing through the Swarm. Once you have gained experience with the responsibilities and what it's like to work in the DAO, you can post a proposal for the role in the forum.

See here for the current breakdown of roles:
