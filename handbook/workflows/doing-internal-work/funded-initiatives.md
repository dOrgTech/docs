# Funded initiatives

Builders who need to do internal work that goes beyond the 22 hours / month cap can do so by proposing a funded initiative.

Funded initiatives are — fundamentally — internal projects. They pursue a high-level goal, have clear deliverables, explicit metrics, a review system, and a budget. Examples might be building the new dOrg landing page, working on a new marketing initiative, creating a new tool to improve customer satisfaction, or organizing a series of workshops to upkill builders skills.

To request funds for an internal project, any builder can post on the forum with their proposal. Every proposal needs to follow the framework reported below. Once a proposal is posted, the DAO will take [a vote on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth).

## Framework for Making a Proposal

{% hint style="success" %}
The core ideas of the framework are derived from [this internal dOrg workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVMk7xkSlYs) on "how to get stuff done that matters".

For your convenience, you can fork this [blank Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZJPHGAeCudegvw7qIhpc0kM1JM\_0M12yY1gdb-yEMg/edit) and fill in the needed information. You have to be logged in with you @dorg.tech account to see it.

### Abstract

Explain in clear terms — briefly, less than 200 words — what you want to achieve. Include this abstract in the forum post as well.

### Strategic objective

Explicitly state which strategic objective(s) you’re targeting from the following list (derived from [this strategic flywheel underpinning the whole dOrg strategy](https://www.figma.com/file/DazpDOLkdGqcjOBv5hzhbh/dOrg-Flywheel-\(Copy\)?node-id=0%3A1)):

1. build tools that empower people to self-organize&#x20;
2. improve our clout&#x20;
3. improve our building expertise&#x20;
4. grow our treasury&#x20;
5. improve builder experience&#x20;
6. improve client experience&#x20;
7. hire outstanding builders&#x20;
8. be hired by amazing clients

Don’t forget to justify your choice: why do you think that your initiative can improve one of the 8 dOrg strategic goals? It’s ok to make assumptions here: any initiative is an experiment, after all. We cannot know in advance whether you’ll be able to achieve what you’re set to achieve: it’s not important to be certain about outcomes; however, it’s crucial to be clear and explicit about intent.

### Detailed description

Tell what you have in mind, and what is your plan to achieve it. In particular:

* The `what`: explain in clear terms what you want to achieve, and the deliverables you’ll ship by the end of the initiative.
* The `why`: what’s broken or missing or needs to be improved on? \[this might partially overlap with the previous section - skip it in case you’re just reiterating the same points]
* The `how`: how do you plan to achieve what you’re set to achieve?

### Success metric

Declare what’s going to be the quantitative metric you’ll use to judge whether the initiative will be successful or not.

The _success metric_ shouldn’t be in your control, so don’t pick once-and-done, 0-1 metrics like ‘create a new CRM’, or ‘publish a new landing page’. The success metric of your initiative should measure the _**outcome**_ of your effort, and should directly affect the strategic objective of your choice.

The success metric should always follow the following template: _“from X to Y by WHEN”_.

For example, “increase the number of Twitter followers from 2000 to 2500 in 3 months from the start of the initiative” (targeting dOrg Strategic Objective #2); or: “raise the builders satisfaction rate from 20% to 50% by June 1st” (targeting dOrg Strategic Objective #5). It’s ok if your forecast turns out to be wrong! What’s important here is to be able to size up the upside of the initiative.

### Progress metrics

State how you’re going to measure process and performance by declaring 1 to 3 _progress metrics_.

A good progress metric has two characteristics: first, it must be within your control; second, it should influence your success metric down the line.

For example, if your initiative is to improve dOrg landing page, and your success metric is the number of daily visitors, some good progress metrics can be: “number of user interviews made before designing the new landing page” or “number of user testing sessions with draft mock-ups”. These are metrics perfectly within your control, but they are also leading — eventually — to the achievement of your success metric.

Your progress metric should follow the same template of your success metric: “_from X to Y by WHEN_”. This allows both you and the DAO to follow progress over time.

### Reviews methodology

After the initiative is approved and funded, an MVP phase of 2 weeks kicks off. It’s an initial period where your assumptions and forecasts get tested in the field.

In this section, you should declare:

* what progress you think you’ll have achieved by the end of the period
* what initial successes you think you’ll have achieved by the end of the period
* name of the reviewer

The reviewer is the person accountable for reviewing how the initiative is doing, and must be external, ie. not be part of the initiative itself. When the MVP phase ends, the reviewer checks:

* whether the team is performing well, by looking at the its progress metrics
* whether the team is achieving initial success, by looking at its success metric
* whether the overall initiative is actually aligned with the stated strategic objective

After the review, the reviewer has to write a very short report (250 words tops) with the three points described above, plus their personal recommendation on whether the initiative should continue or not. Follow [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1bxXHTMacEaLWQ7RklyyansagtGcsTjOu6uC2a5AECCY/edit) for conducting the review. The report should be published on Discord and posted as a forum reply on the relevant Discourse thread. By default, the initiative will continue until the end of funding, but there’s the option to pull the plug (with a snapshot vote).

After the MVP, reviews will continue to happen every 2 weeks until the end of funding, following the same report framework outlined above.

### Funding

Finally, your proposal should recap the conditions of funding:&#x20;

* Start of the funding period
* End of the funding period
* Rates, and other costs associated with the project

The end of funding should mirror the “by WHEN” in the sections on metrics.

It’s ok if you believe that an initiative should be endless. By default, when the funding period ends, funding stops. However, with an explicit new vote, it can resume — provided that the reviews were positive, and success metrics were achieved.

### Assessing Treasury Cash Flows Before Requesting Funding

Before proposing a funded initiative or an internal role, taking into account the historical cash flows of dOrg’s treasury should help inform the scope and cost of your proposal. Members often aren’t sure how much the treasury can spend to remain healthy and sustainable for the long term. For more context on our internal cash flows, refer to this [google sheet of cash flows](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPY7Fb1jkuoi\_PY5pe2rFrUhrDC4Px5NfdizfdRSC\_4/edit?usp=sharing) that is maintained on an ongoing basis by accounting.

![Cash flows at a glance (screenshot taken on 4/18/2022)](<../../.gitbook/assets/Treasury Screenshot.png>)

The dashboard tab shows our average cash flows over three, six and nine month periods. It also displays actual cash flows for the prior three months and the net income (loss) retained by the treasury. The goal is to breakeven or have slightly more inflows than outflows each month. dOrg wants to reinvest into our members and operations while also lessening our tax burden at year end.

To get a sense for how your proposed initiative will affect the treasury’s flows, you can view the historical net income to see how much margin is available to be spent. If our net flows have been negative, then it’s better to wait until our margins flip to positive before proposing a grant. If our treasury has had multiple months of net profit, then our treasury can absorb the cost of a reasonable proposal. The “detailed token flows” tab also has the real-time cash flows for the current month, so you can see our live net profit (loss) right before proposing a new grant. If you have any questions about the treasury and what’s considered a reasonable funding cost, reach out to dOrg’s accountant (mackenzie@dorg.tech).
