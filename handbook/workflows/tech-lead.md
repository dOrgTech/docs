# Tech Lead guide

Each project must have a builder with the `Tech Lead` badge to:

* Own the code quality, making sure that our work product aligns with dOrg's &lt;Development Best Practices&gt;
* Ensure that thereâ€™s a good fit between the builders and their technical responsibilities.

The `Tech Lead` badge is governed by the DAO and issued to builders who meet the following qualifications:

* Successful track record of building on dOrg projects and/or highly visible open source projects
* Confident communicator
* Knows the limits of their skills and how to identify expertise in others
