# Tech Lead guide

Each project must have a builder with the `Tech Lead` badge to:

* Own the code quality, making sure that our work product aligns with dOrg's [Development Best Practices](../resources/best-practice-overview/).
* Ensure fit between the execution team and project requirements.

The precise responsibilities of the Tech Lead will vary from project to project, but here are some recommended practices:

* Make sure you understand all technical requirements, and ask if you don't.
* Evaluate the experience level of each builder and offer mentorship if you see a need.
* Evaluate risk and raise potential issues with other builders, the PM, Sourcing Lead, or client as needed.
* Review pull requests and assist in debugging.
* Check for testing at different levels of the codebase.
* Structure the continuous integration/deployment pipeline and application alerts.
{% endhint %}

Builders can propose to issue the `Tech Lead` badge to any builder who:

* Has a successful track record of building on dOrg projects and/or highly visible open source projects.
* Is a confident communicator.
* Knows the limits of their skills and how to identify expertise in others.
