# Tech Lead guide

Each project must have a builder with the `Tech Lead` badge to:

* Own the code quality, making sure that our work product aligns with dOrg's [Development Best Practices](../resources/best-practice-overview/).
* Ensure fit between the execution team and project requirements.

{% endhint %}

Builders can propose to issue the `Tech Lead` badge to any builder who:

* Has a successful track record of building on dOrg projects and/or highly visible open source projects.
* Is a confident communicator.
* Knows the limits of their skills and how to identify expertise in others.
