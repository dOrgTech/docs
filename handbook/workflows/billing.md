# Billing

For bookkeeping purposes, we prefer you use the same address for rep & payments ;)

## Swarm&#x20;

By the end of the month, members participating at the Swarm have to log their work hours + work done on the [dOrg Internal Improvements Budget (Swarm!) Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j-DsSaP0riIcS-vXUm-A-roIl4CowRloUEjAZXYeNb8/edit#gid=0).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Swarms contributors can choose how they want to receive their compensation per hour:&#x20;

A) 50$ in stable coin + 50 rep (dOrg token)\
B) 25$ in stable coin + 100 rep\
C) 150 rep
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remember: every builder can bill up to 22 hours of work each month without going through a vote (equivalent to a maximum of $1,100/m for compensation option A, or $550 for option B). If you need to go beyond this limit, take a look at [how to propose a Funded Initiative](doing-internal-work/funded-initiatives.md).
{% endhint %}

Afterwards dOrg Treasury signers and accounting will review and approve payment requests within one week. Your compensation will appear on your wallet.

Please, if you need to create an invoice for tax purposes, here's the [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Ky77y9YqhWVERc-rTVQPy3v9NZ\_ZLM4hGKU6AI1Z3M/edit#gid=790763898). Once created email it to [accounting@dorg.tech](mailto:accounting@dorg.tech) ;)

## Client Work

Every client project has its internal flow of billing. Some of them payout members every 2 weeks and others once a month. Make sure to contact your Coordination Lead to get more information on your billing details!&#x20;

Afterwards dOrg Treasury signers and accounting will review and approve payment requests within one week. Your compensation will appear on your wallet.&#x20;

## Internal Roles &#x20;

By the end of the month Internal Roles need to log their hours and + work done on their Outflow Funded Role Forum post. [Take this one as a reference](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/experience-facilitator-anna-marie-ended-dec-10/104/5)! Afterwards dOrg Treasury signers and accounting will review and approve payment requests within one week. Your compensation will appear on your wallet. \

Ask Internal roles to send you a recurrent monthly calendar alert to update your Forum Role work log!&#x20;
