# Billing

## Swarm&#x20;

By the end of the month Builders participating at the Swarm, have to log their work hours + work done on the [dOrg Internal Improvements Budget (Swarm!) Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j-DsSaP0riIcS-vXUm-A-roIl4CowRloUEjAZXYeNb8/edit#gid=0).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Swarms contributors can choose how they want to receive their compensation per hour:&#x20;

A) 50$ in stable coin + 50 rep (dOrg token)\
B) 25$ in stable coin + 150 rep\
C) 200 rep
{% endhint %}

Afterwards dOrg Treasury signers and accounting will review and approve payment requests within one week. Your compensation will appear on your wallet.&#x20;
