## All Hands Meetings

dOrg builders are located all around the globe and collaborate remotely üåê We therefore don't get the opportunity to all hang out very often.\
\
We do, however, have bi-weekly All-Hands meetings, which are held on Thursdays @ 12pm ET Ô∏è/ 6pm CET in the Discord voice channel 'All Members'. \
\
Attending All-Hands meetings are not required but we recommend you attend! New builders have a chance to introduce yourself to the rest of the collective and share what kind of work they're looking for. Plus, meet other builders and get a good overview of the projects we're working on.

To participate on the All Hands Meeting, contact the Experience Facilitator or sign up yourself for a Demo, Tech Talk, Discussions or suggest a Guest Speaker on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HsfV5q1X5QAfB6lUJiK0mYZrpEJ89X7mEzGwAe6ItyE/edit#gid=0). Check out previous recorded events there as well.&#x20;
