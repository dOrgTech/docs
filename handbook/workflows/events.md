## All Hands Meetings

dOrg builders are located all around the globe and collaborate remotely üåê We therefore don't get the opportunity to all hang out very often.\
\
We do, however, have bi-weekly All-Hands meetings, which are held on Thursdays @ 12pm ET Ô∏è/ 6pm CET in the Discord voice channel.\
\
Attending All-Hands meetings are not required but we recommend you attend! You'll have a chance to introduce yourself to the rest of the collective and share what kind of work they're looking for. Plus you'll meet other builders and get a good overview of the projects we're working on.\
\
Please, make sure to integrate your dOrg email address calendar to your primary calendar to receive the biweekly All-Hands meetings calendar invite. [Here](https://docs.dorg.tech/lifecycle/onboarding) you can find the instructions to do so.&#x20;
