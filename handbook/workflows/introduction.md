# Introduction

## Forum - Discourse

The dOrg forum is hosted on Discourse.

The dOrg forum hosts our discussions and proposals about governance, internal projects, activating new builders, and new ideas about systems and builder support. It is also where you look to find client projects to work on, and share your availability. 

There is a Docs & Key Info thread that you will likely find useful as you start building. If a proposal needs the dOrg community to vote on it, we'll create that proposal in [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth) and add a link to the relevant forum post.

## Snapshot

Once proposals have gone through a dialogue process in the forum, they are posted to Snapshot for a formal vote by the DAO. Your voting weight corresponds to your [rep score](https://docs.dorg.tech/governance/rep-and-tokens). 

## Discord

Discord is where day-to-day chat on internal projects and client projects happens. It's also where [sourcing leads](https://docs.dorg.tech/workflows/sourcing) review incoming client project requests, where you will find a running list of snapshot proposals, and where you can ask for help from peer coders if you are stumped on an issue or would like feedback.
