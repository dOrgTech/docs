# Sourcing a New Client Projects

## **1. Initial Contact**

Contact with a potential client projects is generally initiated in one of two ways:

1. **Personal contact**\
   If you have a personal relationship with a potential client, you can proceed as the Sourcing Lead or seek someone else to help or take over.\

2. **Via our Contact Form**\
   Any potential client can complete our [Contact Form](https://www.dorg.tech/#/contact) on our website to share details of their project. Responses are automatically forwarded to the #contact-form channel in Discord.&#x20;

If you see a potential client project that you would like source, react with a ðŸ‘‹ emoji. This is how we indicate our interest (and stops clients from receiving contact from numerous builders).

{% hint style="success" %}
Sourcing is a team sport! Remember that you can co-lead the sourcing process with others and share the rewards.
{% endhint %}

Here is an email template for responding to Contact Form inquiries:

> _Hi \[Name],_
>
> _Thanks so much for your interest in hiring our builder collective. Your submission caught our eye and we'd love to meet with you. We'll discuss your project more in depth and tell you what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg._
>
> _ðŸ¤™**Please schedule a call with me at your earliest. \[Your calendar link]**_
>
> _In the meantime, please prepare an outline of your projectâ€™s requirements that we can review on the call._
>
> _Looking forward to meeting with you!_
>
> _Cheers,_\
> _\[Your Name]_

## 2. Screening Call

The goal of the screening call is to assess the clientâ€™s fit for dOrg and help them understand what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg.&#x20;

Here are some questions to guide your call:

* _How did you hear about dOrg?_
* _Tell me about **the project** and your needs._
* _What does **the team** currently look like?_
* _What is the **tech stack**?_
* _What **skill areas** are needed? (smart contract, web3 integration, design, frontend, etc.)_
* _What is your ideal **timeframe**? How flexible is this?_
* _Do you have a project requirements doc that you could send?_
* _Do you have any other questions about what itâ€™s like to work with dOrg?_

## 3. Team Formation & Builder Interest Call

The next step is to gather interested builders and schedule a technical Q\&A with the client.

1. Post in [Client Projects](https://forum.dorg.tech/t/about-the-client-projects-category/19) in the dOrg forum, following the instructions on the pinned post.
2. You're also encouraged to reach out to particular builders who may be a good fit. [Use the search feature to find builders](https://forum.dorg.tech/search?search\_type=users) by skills, technologies, past projects, and experience level[.](https://forum.dorg.tech/search?search\_type=users)
3. Schedule a call with the client and all interested builders. Make sure that the builders review available materials so that they can be prepared to ask questions during the call.

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to a well-balanced set of builders that match the projectâ€™s needs, each execution team must have a [_Project Manager_](project-manager.md) and [_Tech Lead_](tech-lead.md)__
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Sourcing Leads may also work on the project's execution team.
{% endhint %}

## 4. Statement of Work (SoW)

If the interested builders agree that the project looks promising, does not have major technical issues or execution risks, and that they have the availability and skills to take on the engagement, then proceed with the following.

1. Create SoW on [Pandadoc](https://app.pandadoc.com/a/#/templates-next?sortBy=name\&direction=asc\&displayMode=folders\_first\&mainFilter=all) ([see login credentials here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QXB9Ski8OxHRiELfxq8DcahYFhNnEKPEM20kRjeuYA/edit?usp=sharing)). Go to Templates, hover over â€˜dOrg SoW Templateâ€™, and click â€˜Create Documentâ€™. Fill out the contact details in the prompt and then fill in the different sections of the contract (no need to fill in address, as this is a client variable):
   * Context & Objectives
   * Focus Areas
   * Token Allocation (if applicable)
   * Billing Summary
2. Update the forum post you made earlier with the draft SoW to get feedback from the interested builders on the timeframe, pricing, and scope.
3. Send the SoW to the client through PandaDoc. Revise if reasonable and necessary based on the clientâ€™s feedback.
4. Once the client has signed, to submit a proposal to the DAO through [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dorg.eth) that links to the forum post.

## 5. Invoicing&#x20;

1. Once the proposal passes, create a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/welcome) on mainnet with the _Sourcing Lead_, _Project Manager_, _Tech Lead_, and all other committed builders as signers. Examples of required signers: 2/3, 3/5, 4/7.
2. Invoice the client via [Gilded](https://app.gilded.finance/auth/login) ([see login credentials here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QXB9Ski8OxHRiELfxq8DcahYFhNnEKPEM20kRjeuYA/edit?usp=sharing))
   * First add the new Gnosis Safe to our accounts: Accounts > Add Account > Input address > Wallet Address
   * Next, create the first invoice:
     * Payments > Invoices > New Invoice >&#x20;
     * Add Contact (enter client details, leave eth address blank)  >
     * Go to payment method > Set the details (select the Account you created above as the payment destination; for tokens select USDC and DAI) > Send
3. Continue to invoice on the agreed upon schedule. Regularly monitor the project's health through the _Project Manager_ and _Tech Lead_, making sure to step in and help resolve any issues that arise.
