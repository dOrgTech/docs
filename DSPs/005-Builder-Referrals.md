## Summary

Builder referral model that ties incentive to revenue generated by the referred builder. 

## Why should we fund this?

For dOrg to continue to provide high quality service and take on exciting projects, the organization needs to be able to attract and maintain top engineering talent.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

The incentive will be equivalent to 10% of the referred builder's first $50k earned from client work. dOrg currently makes 12.5 cents on every dollar earned by a builder on client work. In the case of a referred builder, dOrg would effectively earn 2.5 cents instead, with the remaining 10 cents going to the referrer.

In order to simplify the tracking overhead, referral incentives will be payable to referrers at 4 milestones:
1. $5k (-> $500)
2. $15k (-> $1000)
3. $25k (-> $1000)
4. $50k (-> $2500)

(Max Commission: $5,000 total)

Advantages of the model:
- The revenue generated by the referred builder pays for the referral incentive
- Simple to understand, account for, and track
- Pays out gradually, has caps so the costs are controlled
- Doesn't take money out of the referred builder's pocket

## Cost Breakdown

80% of dOrg's 10% Margin on the first $50k of client work compensation earned by each newly referred builder (max $5K per new builder)
