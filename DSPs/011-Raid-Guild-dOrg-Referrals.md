# Proposal Title

**Author(s)**: @benefacto

## Summary

Establish a reciprocal sales referral program for [dOrg](https://dorg.tech/) and [Raid Guild](https://raidguild.org/) commesurate to five percent (5%) of the total project budget. 

## Why should we fund this?

This arrangement could result in new revenue for both organizations by maximizing usage of our varying capacities and availabilities.
It could also represent the beginnings of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) consortium to broadly promote digital cooperatives and the future of work.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

For sales referred to Raid Guild, the funds will be payable to the dOrg DAO @ `dorg.eth` (0x15344ecdc2c4edfcb092e284d93c20f0529fd8a6).
For sales referred to dOrg, the funds will be payable to the Raid Guild DAO [here](https://pokemol.com/dao/0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d) (0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d).

## Cost

Five Percent (5%) of the total project budget of any referred sale.
