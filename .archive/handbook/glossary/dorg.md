![At dOrg we are creating &quot;digital organisms&quot;](../.gitbook/assets/dorgs2.gif)

**dOrg** - a self-service web3 development agency; structured as a reputation-weighted DAO with legal personality

**Reputation** - voting weight on proposals to the DAO; non-transferrable

**DORG Token** - token issued by the DAO to track unpaid obligations

**Proposal** - basic unit of decision-making for any DAO action \(payments, adding/removing Rep, issuing Tokens, ratifying agreements, modifying the DAO, and more\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Anyone can **submit** a proposal to the DAO. Anyone with reputation in the DAO can **vote** to approve or reject a proposal. All votes are be **publicly visible** in the [Ethereum](web3.md#ethereum) Blockchain. If the proposal **passes**, anyone can **execute** the action specified.

Submitting, voting and executing proposals costs [Gas](web3.md#gas).
{% endhint %}

**DAOstack** - Ethereum-based DAO framework that dOrg is built on \([mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x15344ecdc2c4edfcb092e284d93c20f0529fd8a6), [xDAI](https://v1.alchemy.do/dao/0x94a587478c83491b13291265581cb983e7feb540/scheme/0xca275b54cf9e9afc2317778e3e294e01a5b25ce9e082043b64a5cc7f4c4ec2f9)\)

**Builder** - anyone who holds reputation in the DAO; can be active or inactive; [view all active builders here](https://dorg.tech/membrane/)

**Client** - entities who contract dOrg for web3 development services

**3rd Party** - external entities that dOrg interacts with for services \(SaaS, accountants, lawyers, governments\)

**Spaces** - tools utilized by active builders to synchronize workflows

**Sync** - biweekly call for active builders

**Open House** - open quarterly call to reflect on progress and welcome newcomers
