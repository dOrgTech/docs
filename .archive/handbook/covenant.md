* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Assuming good intentions
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Taking ownership of our commitments and communicating changes with multiple weeks notice
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Encouraging transparency and collaboration while preserving privacy where reasonably expected
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
