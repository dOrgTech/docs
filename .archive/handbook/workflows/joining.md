# Joining a Client Project

{% hint style="info" %}
It is the builder's responsibility to make sure to understand the compensation model for each client. Ask project Sourcing Lead for help if you don't find the information.
{% endhint %}

## Finding a project to join

1. Express interest in any [Client Projects](https://forum.dorg.tech/c/clientproject/8) by commenting on the forum thread. You can also check for opportunities in our `job-board` channel in Discord. Lastly, you could also check our WIP [dOrg data app](https://share.streamlit.io/dorgtech/dorg\_data/app.py) - make sure to not use Brave navigator, have access to dOrg Github (if not ask Experience Facilitator), plus request access to WHYTEWYLL#7455.
2. If the _Coordination Lead_ and _QA Lead_ of that project determine that your skills and availability match the project's needs, they will reach out to schedule a walkthrough.
3. If it's a match, the _Coordination Lead_ will update the project's post with your start date, time commitment, and role.
4. Sign Statement of Work document for each new Client Project that you start. Find the document on your GDrive 'dOrg Personnel Folders'&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also DM our Experience Facilitator, Clara, on Discord for help with finding opportunities!

## Contributing to a project

1. Familiarize yourself with the project details noted in its forum post (code repos, project boards, SoW, QA Worksheet, etc.).
2. Attend weekly syncs. Make sure you are prepared and join a few minutes early with a stable internet connection and good audio.
3. Self-assign issues in the project board while communicating with other members to avoid overlap and ensuring you are working on the highest priority tasks.
4. Log your work and time in the project's budget spreadsheet before each payment checkpoint.
5. At each payment checkpoint, review your teammates' logs and sign-off on the transaction initiated by the _Coordination Lead_.
6. Participate in periodic feedback surveys and retro sessions initiated by the _Coordination Lead_.

#### **Tips & Tricks**

* Follow [dOrg's Development Best Practices](../resources/best-practice-overview/).
* Share updates and questions with the rest of the team as you build.
* If you run into any issues, technical or otherwise, ask your team for help or post in the #help channel on Discord to tap into the dOrg hive mind.
* If you feel that a project is going over scope or needs more time, discuss this with the _Coordination Lead_ or _QA Lead_ as soon as possible so that adjustments can be made.
