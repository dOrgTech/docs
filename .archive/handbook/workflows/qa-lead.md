# Being a QA Lead

Each project must have a member with the `QA Lead` badge (formerly `Tech Lead`) that has been designated to:

* Own the code quality, making sure that our work product aligns with dOrg's [Development Best Practices](../resources/best-practice-overview/).
* Ensure fit between the execution team and project requirements.

{% hint style="success" %}
The precise responsibilities of the QA Lead will vary from project to project, but here are some recommended practices:

* Make sure you understand all technical requirements, and ask if you don't.
* Evaluate the experience level of each team member and offer mentorship if you see a need.
* Evaluate risk and raise potential issues with other team members, the Coordination Lead, Sourcing Lead, or client as needed.
* Review pull requests and assist in debugging.
* Check for testing at different levels of the codebase.
* Structure the continuous integration/deployment pipeline and application alerts.
{% endhint %}

Members can propose to issue the `QA Lead` badge to any member who:

* Has a successful track record of building on dOrg projects and/or highly visible open source projects.
* Is a confident communicator.
* Knows the limits of their skills and how to identify expertise in others.
