# DORG Token Redemption

| Budget | Term | Lead (hr/wk ) |
|-|-|-|
| [2,000 DAI + 2,000 DORG]() | 1 month (Dec 15 - Jan 15 '21) | Nestor B (15) |

## Summary

Build the UI Client for the dOrg token redemption/staking contracts.

## Why should we fund this?

This project will give usability to the current dOrg token deployed contract. It will let the token holder redeem it for a choice of the preferred stablecoin, it will also enable the ability to stake the token to earn an APR based on the amount of dOrg token the holder commits to staking.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

**Scope:** 

**StableRedemption UI:** 
This feature let's the user connect to the StableRedemption contract that will be deployed on Mainnet, using the DORG token contract as the input token and setting a list of 4 stable coins as the redeem tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI, TUSD).

The user is able to redeem their DORG tokens for any of the whitelisted stablecoins. Also it has the feature to add a new stablecoin to the list (this new stablecoin needs to be whitelisted and funded into the StableRedemption contract by the DAO).

**StakingRewards UI:**
This feature let's the user connect to the StakingReward contract that will be deployed on Mainnet, using the DORG token as the input token and by setting an APR to it https://github.com/dOrgTech/token-redemption/issues/10

The user is able to stake/unstake/claim rewards/unstake and claim rewards/claim partial rewards based on the amount of DORG tokens on his wallet (to stake) or the amount of rewards he has gained by staking (staking rewards).
