## Summary

Create a flagship video to test the Clade project hypothesis, for bridging the world of DAOâ€™s with the broader world of cooperative organizations and future of work.

* Produce 3-5 minute video: showing the history of work and how digital cooperatives are the future of work; with animation and narration.
* Research topics from a civilian perspective: Identify 3-4 key words or phrases that people are searching that this content provides answers and resources to. Our audiences are: existing cooperatives, freelancers, activist communities.
* Publish video to aligned communities for feedback.
* Review effectiveness and assess next steps: evaluate if we have created quality content and if there is sufficient audience and partner interest to move forward.

## Why should we fund this?

* To begin the Clade project as a place for dOrg builders to share about what we're creating here and the DAO space as a whole, why it's meaningful to us, and help more people experience liberation through these modes of organizing together
* Show to partners who are interested in helping to fund future content, so we can continue creating content and value (revenue) streams - [see brainstorm document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POTlN4AsxBk-Gv8eYzRmyqh8muvFcOg2hanb6yUEEio/edit)
* This is a video we can show to people about how dOrg works, whether client or builder

Clade as a spin-off project has been in discussion in dOrg since September 2020.
