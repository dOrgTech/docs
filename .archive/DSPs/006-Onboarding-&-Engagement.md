## Summary

This proposal establishes a new workstream focused on improving the quality of builder engagement across the DAO. Weâ€™ll guide this work stream by
- Facilitating effective & ongoing collaboration
- Coordinating work bins to achieve measurable outcomes
- Analyzing and reporting our progress to the DAO
- Unifying work bins into learning milestones, so that we can evolve & iterate

## Why should we fund this?

We need to continue to have dedicated people maintaining and improving our processes as we continue to take on on a higher volume of projects and builders.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

This workstream covers the quality of engagement with and within the DAO at any of these stages:
- Discovering the DAO
- Onboarding
- Project enrollment
- Ongoing empowerment
- Builder referrals & client sourcing

Sample tasks will likely include these and more...
- Map the [Member Journey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z47NnQ91T0OvlHFYXhwEY9SSEmz1Tj0MpNeT695XKJE/edit)
- Gather feedback about builder experiences through focus group surveys
- Iterate on the website redesign
- Redesign client proposal template
- Migrate CRM from Airtable to HubSpot

This workstream will lead to new initiatives as well as build off of existing ones, such as:
- [DSP 2: Q4 2020 Ops Roles](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/blob/master/DSPs/002-Ops-Roles.md)
- [DSP 4: Landing Page Redesign](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/blob/master/DSPs/004-Landing-Page.md)
- [DSP 5: Builder Referrals](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/blob/master/DSPs/005-Builder-Referrals.md)
- [Issue 70 Gamifying QA](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/issues/72)
- [Issue 72 Improve activation/onboarding funnel](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/issues/70)
