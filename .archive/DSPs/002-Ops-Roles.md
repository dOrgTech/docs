## Summary

Designate leads and fixed weekly budgets for admin, facilitation, and comms.

## Why should we fund this?

Having well-defined areas with leads will help us avoid diffusion of responsibilities for crucial operational tasks, while creating higher transparency for the entire organization of who is handling what.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

While each role has a lead, anyone from dOrg is welcome to contribute and earn from the role budgets.
