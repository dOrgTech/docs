| Budget | Term | Lead (hr/wk ) |
|-|-|-|
| 5% of revenue from referred projects | Perpetual | Ben |

## Summary

Establish a reciprocal qualified sales referral program for [dOrg](https://dorg.tech/) and [Raid Guild](https://raidguild.org/) commesurate to five percent (5%) of the total project budget. 

## Why should we fund this?

This arrangement could result in new revenue for both organizations by maximizing usage of our varying capacities and availabilities.
It could also represent the beginnings of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) consortium to broadly promote digital cooperatives and the future of work.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

For qualified sales referred to Raid Guild, the funds will be payable to the dOrg DAO @ `dorg.eth` (0x15344ecdc2c4edfcb092e284d93c20f0529fd8a6).
For qualified sales referred to dOrg, the funds will be payable to the Raid Guild DAO [here](https://pokemol.com/dao/0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d) (0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d).

## Cost Breakdown

Five percent (5%) of the total project budget of any referred sale
Within dOrg, half of this amount will go to the source lead that provides sales qualfication before referral to Raid Guild.
