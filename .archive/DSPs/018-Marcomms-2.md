## Summary
This DSP funds all marketing & communications efforts including social media management, content creation, communication materials such as decks or slides, event management, search engine optimization, and talent recruitment. At the end of each MarComms DSP, we'll deliver a report with the relevant metrics and highlights from the month.

Purpose
- Position dOrg as a thought leader in our space
- Associate dOrg with keywords (DAOs, NFTs, DeFi)
- Build community
- Build brand awareness
- Increase website KPIs such as visits, leads
- Increase number of talent applications by qualified builders (tech & non-tech)

## Why should we fund this?

1. Having a robust online presence will solidify dOrgâ€™s brand, and will increase our likelihood to close client projects and attract and retain top-tier talent.
2. High-Value Content is an excellent vehicle for thought-leadership, decentralization is a relatively new space and as a first-mover this creates an ideal opportunity to remain a leader in the space through original content generation.
3. Content will make it easier for members to talk and communicate about dOrg to friends, family, coworkers, prospective clients, and the community at large.
4. Every content initiative will be measured and tracked so as to be able to get a sense of which initiative is driving the most value, and optimize against it.
5. Ultimately, we want dOrg to have a strong presence in the blockchain space, and solidify its leadership position as the go-to for all things Web3 - which can be achieved if we begin to generate long-lasting favorability starting today.
